## What is Mixpeek?

You likely have combinations of unstructured and structured data that spans various modalities: documents, images, video and audio not the least of which is text. 

Mixpeek is a multimodal replication pipeline that connects to your database, automatically extracts, embeds and generates outputs before sending it right back into your database. 

## What does it enable?

Since you'll have fresh vectors, metadata and extracted contents you can design queries that span all your use cases:

- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Recommendation
- Search


### First create a DB connection

```shell Shell
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.mixpeek.com/users' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "connections": [
        {
            "engine": "mongodb",
            "host": "sandbox.mhsby.mongodb.net",
            "port": 5432,
            "database": "",
            "username": "",
            "password": ""
        }
    ]
}'
```

<Note>
Connection passwords are encrypted at rest using [symmetric encryption](https://github.com/mixpeek/server/blob/master/src/api/utilities/encryption.py) and all transmissions are via TLS.
</Note>


### Create your Pipeline

```shell Shell
curl --location 'https://api.mixpeek.com/pipelines' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "source_destination_mappings": [
        {
            "embedding_model": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
            "source": {
                "field": "resume_url",
                "type": "file_url",
                "settings": {}
            },
            "destination": {
                "collection": "resume_embeddings",
                "field": "text",
                "embedding": "embedding"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

This defines how you want the replication to work. It's saying: whenever there is a new document with a field: `resume_url` process it as if it's a `file_url`, create embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and send the outputs to the new collection: `resume_embeddings`

### Sit back and enjoy

Now we have fresh vectors, metadata and text to design rich queries on top of!!! 

```json JSON
{
  "text": "3. Analyses by segment 3.1 Operating segments Revenue and results",
  "embedding": [
    0.013505205512046814,
    -0.047882888466119766,
    0.07246698439121246,
    ...
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "filetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",
    "languages": [
      "eng"
    ],
    "page_name": "OS-Rev.and results 30 06 2023",
    "page_number": 1
  },
  "parent_id": "660c54a3cf034216d03bf1db"
}
```

You can use the `parent_id` to merge the embedding chunks on querytime.

## Extra credit:

Leverage the `extract`, `embed` and `generate` methods to design a custom pipeline via the `workflow` service:

```python
mixpeek.extract()

mixpeek.generate()

mixpeek.embed()
```


<Note>
  Mixpeek cloud is currently in **private beta**. To use the API, you need to
  [register an API key](https://mixpeek.com/start) and an engineer will contact
  you.
