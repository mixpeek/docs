<Note>Note: The Mixpeek API is currently in Alpha. Please reach out to us at [info@mixpeek.com](mailto:info@mixpeek.com) if you plan on using it. Also you can join our <a href="https://mixpeek.com/community">Slack Channel</a> if you get stuck</Note>


## What is Mixpeek?

Mixpeek is an intelligence layer on top of your object store like S3. By using NLP, it grants you an "understanding" of your non-text files with just a GET <a href="/api-search/search">/search</a> API call. 

## 1. Create Authentication Token

Mixpeek uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a Mixpeek API key using [this page](https://m0ya3ewpknw.typeform.com/to/RGu9rcJk). Your API key acts as a **tenancy** to ensure you can only search the contents of your uploaded files.

| Environments  |                                             |                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `production` | Live environment to use with real users | https://api.mixpeek.com         |

Mixpeek expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server within the `header` that looks like the following:

```
Authorization: API_KEY
```

### Confirm Authorization

To confirm authorization, use this code:

<CodeGroup>
```shell Shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mixpeek.com/' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY'
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Response

If authorization is successful, you will receive this response:

```json
{
    "credits_remaining": 1000
}
```

The `credits_remaining` number indicates how many files you're able to upload.
Every account starts with `1000` regardless of your subscription plan.
Each time you upload a new file you reduce that credit count by `1`.
To issue more credits, sign into your [account](https://mixpeek.com/start).

## 2. Index File

We strongly recommend you use the Mixpeek [Python library](/introduction/libraries) available via:

```shell Install
  pip install git+https://github.com/mixpeek/mixpeek-python.git@master
```

In order to make your files searchable, you must upload your files to the Mixpeek API.
The engine will extract its' contents, save the output then promptly delete the file.

Optionally, you can index your entire S3 bucket via [/index-many](/api-file/index-many)

### Request
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mix = Mixpeek(api_key="API_KEY")

# index one local pdf document without any additional metadata
mix.index("/path/to/file/document.pdf")

# with extra metadata
mix.index("/path/to/file/document.pdf", user_id="john_smith_123", tags="document, legal", static_file_url="cdn.host.com/document.pdf")
```
```shell cURL
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/file/index-one' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
--form 'file=@"path/to/file/document.pdf"'
```
</CodeGroup>


### Response
<CodeGroup>
```json JSON
  {"file_id":"63a47050660c021b5027166e"}
```
</CodeGroup>


## 3. Search for Files

Once your files' contents are extracted they will become searchable via the `/search` endpoint.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# simple search
mix.search(query="system")

# search with additional parameters
mix.search("system", user_id="john_smith_123", context="true", tags="legal, document")
```
```shell cURL
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/search?q=system' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
```
</CodeGroup>
