Welcome to the Mixpeek documentation guide. This guide will help you get started with Mixpeek and how to integrate Mixpeek into your software.

## What is Mixpeek?
Mixpeek is a tool that allows you to set up data processing pipelines. It is designed to process various data formats, including structured and unstructured data, and can transform new files added to object stores into structured data for applications to use. It supports the processing of different file types such as documents, images, videos, audio and text. 

Mixpeek is useful for handling data from object stores like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Store, or Google Cloud Storage and databases like Postgres or MongoDB.

## How does Mixpeek Work?

It is a chain of user-defined tasks that are applied to your objects as they're added to your own storage, processed, and sent to your transactional database.
This allows you to structure your unstructured data using custom, powerful logic in real-time.
