<Note>Note: The Mixpeek API is currently in Alpha. Please reach out to us at [info@mixpeek.com](mailto:info@mixpeek.com) if you plan on using it.</Note>


## 1. Create Authentication Token

mixpeek uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a mixpeek API key using [this page](https://m0ya3ewpknw.typeform.com/to/RGu9rcJk).

mixpeek expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server within the header that looks like the following:

```bash
Authorization: API_KEY
```

### 2. Confirm Authorization

To confirm authorization, use this code:

<CodeGroup>
```shell shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mixpeek.com/' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY'
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Response

If authorization is successful, you will receive this response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "endpoint": "/",
  "ok": true,
  "response": {
    "credits_remaining": 999832
  },
  "timestamp": 1659218867.561593
}
```

Notice the `credits_remaining` key. Every account starts with credits, and each time you run a search you reduce that credit count by 1. To issue more credits, sign into your [account](https://m0ya3ewpknw.typeform.com/to/RGu9rcJk).

### 3. Upload File

In order to make your files searchable, you must upload your files to the mixpeek API. The engine will extract its' contents, save the output then promptly delete the file. We recommend providing a reference url for the static hosted file so you can render the file in your software.

<CodeGroup>
```shell shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.mixpeek.com/upload' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY' \
--form 'file=@"LOCAL_FILE_PATH"' \
--data-raw '{"file_path":"HOSTED_FILE_PATH"}'
```
</CodeGroup>


### 4. Search for Files

Once your files' contents are extracted they will become searchable via the `GET /search` API.

<CodeGroup>
```shell shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mixpeek.com/search?q=SEARCH_QUERY' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY'
```
</CodeGroup>
