## What is Mixpeek?

Mixpeek connects to your existing database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL or object stores like S3. 

Every change in your storage, an embedding is generated and sent to your vector DB of choice. It supports text, image, video and audio so you can do multimodal search with ease. 

Best of all, it's open source! Alternatively, we can manage everything for you.

<Note>
  Mixpeek cloud is currently in **private beta**. To use the API, you need to
  [register an API key](https://mixpeek.com/start) and an engineer will contact
  you.
