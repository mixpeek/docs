<Note>Note: The Mixpeek API is currently in Alpha. Please reach out to us at [info@mixpeek.com](mailto:info@mixpeek.com) if you plan on using it.</Note>


## Authenticate

mixpeek uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a mixpeek API key using [this page](https://m0ya3ewpknw.typeform.com/to/RGu9rcJk).

mixpeek expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server within the header that looks like the following:

```bash
Authorization: API_KEY
```

Notice the `credits_remaining` key. Every account starts with credits, and each time you run a search you reduce that credit count by 1. To issue more credits, sign into your [account](https://m0ya3ewpknw.typeform.com/to/RGu9rcJk).

### Confirm Authorization

To confirm authorization, use this code:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
  'Authorization': 'API_KEY'
}

response = requests.request("GET", 'https://api.mixpeek.com/', headers=headers)
```

```shell shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.mixpeek.com/' \
--header 'Authorization: API_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("Authorization", "API_KEY");

var requestOptions = {
  method: "GET",
  headers: myHeaders,
  redirect: "follow",
};

fetch("https://api.mixpeek.com/", requestOptions)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.log("error", error));
```

```ruby Ruby
require "uri"
require "net/http"

url = URI("https://api.mixpeek.com/")

https = Net::HTTP.new(url.host, url.port)
https.use_ssl = true

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url)
request["Authorization"] = "API_KEY"

response = https.request(request)
puts response.read_body
```

</CodeGroup>

### Response

If authorization successful, you will receive this response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "endpoint": "/",
  "ok": true,
  "response": {
    "credits_remaining": 999832
  },
  "timestamp": 1659218867.561593
}
```
