## What is Mixpeek?

[Mixpeek](https://mixpeek.com) provides vision understanding infrastructure for developers.

Using our set of APIs, you can pull out structured data out of videos and images like embeddings, objects, text, and more.

These files can come from object storage like Amazon S3 or real-time feeds like RTSP.

You can use the end-to-end indexing and retrieval APIs (Easy but Rigid) or the SDK methods directly (Flexible but Complex).

## How Does It Work?

<Note>[Comprehensive achitecture guide](/introduction/architecture)</Note>

1. **Connect Datastores**: Integrate your existing datastores, such as S3 and MongoDB.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Add files (images, videos, audio, text, documents) to S3.
3. **Access and Query**: Access the freshly structured data to build rich queries.

See the [quick start guide](/introduction/quickstart) to get started.
