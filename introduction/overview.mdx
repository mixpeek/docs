## What is Mixpeek?

[Mixpeek](https://mixpeek.com) is a multimodal intelligence platform.

It allows you to pull structured data out of unstructed file types like images, videos, audio and text.

These files can come from object storage like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage and the structured output directly into your database or application.

You can use the end-to-end indexing and retrieval APIs or the SDK methods directly.

## Use Cases

<Note>
  Check the [use case section](/use-cases) for live demos, code, videos, and
  guides
</Note>

- **Search Engines**: Enhance search capabilities with rich, multimodal data.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Improve recommendations using diverse data sources.
- **Content Management**: Streamline and manage multimedia content efficiently.
- **Data Analytics**: Perform advanced analytics with structured, multimodal data.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Build and maintain comprehensive knowledge graphs with real-time updates.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Use the structured data to power advanced AI models for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

## How Does It Work?

<Note>[Comprehensive achitecture guide](/introduction/architecture)</Note>

1. **Connect Datastores**: Integrate your existing datastores, such as S3 and MongoDB.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Add files (images, videos, audio, text, documents) to S3.
3. **Access and Query**: Access the freshly structured data to build rich queries.
