## What is Mixpeek?

Mixpeek provides flexible vision understanding infrastructure for developers. It simplifies the process of extracting, analyzing, and utilizing data from visual assets like videos and images.

### The Traditional Approach

Today, developers face a complex and time-consuming process to build a robust vision understanding system:

1. **Accept Requests**: Design and implement an API gateway to handle incoming requests
2. **Manage Data Volumes**: Set up a queuing system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to manage large volumes of data
3. **Content Segmentation**: Develop video/image chunking algorithms to break content into semantically independent segments
4. **Efficient Processing**: Create a batching system for efficient use of inference services
5. **Feature Extraction**: Implement asynchronous feature extraction pipelines for various attributes (objects, text, faces, etc.)
6. **Data Indexing**: Design and build a hierarchical indexing system for efficient data storage and retrieval
7. **Search Functionality**: Develop a hybrid search functionality that can handle text, image, and video inputs
8. **Storage Synchronization**: Ensure synchronization with upstream storage systems
9. **System Reliability**: Implement robust consistency, durability, and availability measures for all components
10. **Scalability**: Continuously maintain and scale the infrastructure as data volumes grow

This process requires significant time, expertise, and resources to develop and maintain.

### The Mixpeek Solution

Mixpeek handles all of these complex backend processes, allowing you to focus on building innovative features and applications. With Mixpeek, you can achieve the same functionality in just three lines of code:

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mp = Mixpeek(api_key="your_api_key")
mp.index("https://example.com/your_video.mp4")
mp.search("cat")
```
