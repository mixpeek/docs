Only Mixpeek's embedding models are exposed to you as a developer because you need it to do KNN. Whichever models you select via `embed` are optionally open source via HuggingFace or can be embedded for KNN via `mixpeek.embed()`.

`extract` and `generate` are abstracted so that we can swap in and out the best in class approaches.

When using the mixpeek SDK methods, you provide the `model` in each payload like:

```python
mixpeek.embed(model="jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en", modality="text")
```

The list below are all the embedding models currently supported in the SDK. For embed, use the dimensions to create your DB index.

<Note>
  We add models regularly, so if we're missing any

If you'd like to understand which models we're using for `generate` and `extract` we'd be happy to share.
