To fine-tune any of the models (`extract`, `generate`, and `embed`), follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Annotated Data">
    Send your annotated data to an S3 bucket and connect it via the
    <a href="/connections/s3">Connections</a> service. This will return a `connection_id`.
    Ensure the data is well-organized and labeled according to the model's requirements
    (we'll provide specs)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Fine-Tuning">
    Use the Mixpeek API to start a fine-tuning job. Specify the base
    `model_id`, the S3 bucket path, and `specs` that tell the fine-tuner how to run:

    ```python
    mixpeek.models.tune(
      model_id="jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en",
      annotation={
        "connection_id": "conn_123",
        "specs": "specs.json"
      }
    )
    ```

    This will return a new model_id that you can use in your pipeline, for example: `model_1askdh2390`, which you'll then use in your methods like:

    ```python
      mixpeek.embed.text(model_id="model_1askdh2390", input="hello")
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Version Control">
    It's recommended to store the version_id of each model state as it is fine-tuned. 
    
    If you append a `model_version` in the metadata of the pipeline it'll automatically be added to your database so you can do query-time filtering:

    ```python
    mixpeek.pipelines.create(
      ...
      destination={
        ...
        "metadata": {
          "model_version": "model_1askdh2390"
        }
      }
    )
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
