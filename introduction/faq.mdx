### Other frequently asked questions

<Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    We have a free-forever tier, but if you require advanced features and high volume usage you can leverage our credit-usage model. Simply purchase credits within your <a href="https://dash.mixpeek.com">dashboard</a> and as you use the API your credit count will diminish. You will receive warnings as your credit consumption reduces to zero. Once it does, you'll default to free-tier features. This will not impact your Mixpeek API.

<Accordion title="How does Mixpeek compare to alternatives?">
    As a developer, you have two options:
        1. Train your vector embedding models on specific filetypes (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/openai/CLIP">CLIP</a> for images, <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a> for audio, etc.)
        2. Extract the contents of each of these file types into a standard output: text

    Mixpeek is the only object-store agnostic, multi-modal API that grants NLP-like Q&A to users without having to manage any ML, data wranging, etc.
