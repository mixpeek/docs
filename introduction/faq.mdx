<Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    We have a free-forever tier, but if you require advanced features and high volume usage you can leverage our credit-usage model. Simply purchase credits within your <a href="https://dash.mixpeek.com">dashboard</a> and as you use the API (uploads and search) your credit count will diminish. You will receive warnings as your credit consumption reduces to zero. Once it does, you'll default to free-tier features. This will not impact your Mixpeek API.

<Accordion title="How does Mixpeek compare to alternatives?">
    As a developer, you have two options:
        1. Train your vector embedding models on specific filetypes (i.e. CLIP for images, Whisper for audio, etc.)
        2. Extract the contents of each of these file types into a standard output: text

    Mixpeek is the only object-store agnostic, multi-modal API that grants NLP-like Q&A to users without having to manage any ML, data wranging, etc.
