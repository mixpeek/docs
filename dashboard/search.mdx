## Select a Collection

Collections are where your files are stored. You can select multiple collections to search across.

The results of each search are ordered by relevance. Each result is clickable, and will open the file details modal.

## Image Modality

Once images have been uploaded from the `/collections` page, you can search by text or by file.

### Search by Text

Videos can be uploaded from the `/collections` page as well, and you have two displays whith video responses:
