## View Files in a Collection

By clicking a collection card, you can view all the files in that collection.

On this screen you'll see a list of files which span all your modalities, including text, image, audio, and video. You can also view the file details, such as the file name, modality, and file type.

Each file has a status, which can be `processing`, `initalizing`, `done`, or `failed`. This status will update as the file is processed.
