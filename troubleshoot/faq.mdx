## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Mixpeek?">
    Mixpeek is a multimodal data processing and retrieval platform. It ingests raw files (video, images, audio, PDFs, text), extracts features (embeddings, transcriptions, structured data), and enables semantic search across all modalities through a unified API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Objects and Documents?">
    **Objects** are raw inputs registered in buckets (e.g., a video file, PDF, JSON payload). They're validated but not processed.

    **Documents** are processed outputs created by feature extractors. They live in collections, include vectors/embeddings, and are queryable via retrievers.

    Flow: `Object → Batch → Engine → Document`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know machine learning to use Mixpeek?">
    No. Mixpeek abstracts away model selection, infrastructure, and scaling. You declare what features you want (e.g., text embeddings, scene detection) via simple JSON configurations. We handle training, hosting, and optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I bring my own models?">
    Custom models are available for Enterprise customers. Contact us via "Talk to Engineers" to discuss integration options.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ingestion & Processing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does batch processing take?">
    Depends on:
    - **Object count:** 100 objects typically process in 1-5 minutes
    - **File size:** Large videos (>1GB) take longer
    - **Extractors:** Video/audio extractors are slower than text
    - **Ray cluster size:** More workers = faster throughput

    Monitor progress via Task API:
    ```bash
    GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if processing fails mid-batch?">
    Partial results are written to Qdrant. Documents will have:
    - `__fully_enriched: false`
    - `__missing_features: ["list", "of", "failed", "features"]`

    You can:
    1. Query partial results (filter by `__fully_enriched: true`)
    2. Reprocess failed objects individually
    3. Inspect Engine logs for failure reasons
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update documents after creation?">
    Yes. Use the Collection Documents API:
    ```bash
    PATCH /v1/collections/{collection_id}/documents/{document_id}
    { "metadata": { "status": "reviewed" } }
    ```

    Or batch update:
    ```bash
    POST /v1/collections/{collection_id}/documents/batch-update
    ```

    **Note:** Updating metadata doesn't re-run feature extractors. To reprocess, create a new batch with the source object.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete documents?">
    Two approaches:

    **1. Delete specific documents:**
    ```bash
    DELETE /v1/collections/{collection_id}/documents/{document_id}
    ```

    **2. Delete all documents from an object:**
    ```bash
    DELETE /v1/buckets/{bucket_id}/objects/{object_id}?cascade=true
    ```

    This removes the object and all derived documents across collections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file formats are supported?">
    | Type | Formats |
    |------|---------|
    | **Video** | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM |
    | **Image** | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF |
    | **Audio** | MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A |
    | **Document** | PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown |
    | **Structured** | JSON, CSV |

    For unsupported formats, pre-convert or contact support for custom extractors.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search & Retrieval

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between KNN search and hybrid search?">
    **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** Pure vector similarity using dense embeddings.
    - Best for: Semantic search, natural language queries
    - Example: "Find articles about climate change"

    **Hybrid Search:** Combines dense vectors + sparse (BM25) keyword matching via RRF fusion.
    - Best for: Queries mixing semantics + exact terms
    - Example: "React hooks API reference" (needs both concept and keyword matching)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many collections can a retriever query?">
    Unlimited. Specify multiple collection IDs:
    ```json
    { "collection_ids": ["col_text", "col_images", "col_videos"] }
    ```

    Results are fused across collections based on stage configurations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I search across multiple namespaces?">
    No. The `X-Namespace` header enforces hard isolation. Each request operates within a single namespace.

    **Workaround:** Make separate requests per namespace and merge results client-side.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I search by image?">
    1. Create a collection with `image_extractor`
    2. Build a retriever with KNN search on `clip_embedding`
    3. Pass image URL in `inputs`:

    ```bash
    POST /v1/retrievers/{retriever_id}/execute
    {
      "inputs": {
        "query_image": "s3://my-bucket/sample.jpg"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the max result limit?">
    **Per query:** 10,000 documents (pagination required for larger result sets)

    **Per stage:** Configurable `limit` parameter (e.g., retrieve 100 candidates, rerank top 20)

    **Best practice:** Use filters and sorts to narrow results before pagination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Mixpeek for real-time search?">
    Yes. Typical latency:
    - Simple KNN: 20-50ms
    - Hybrid search: 50-150ms
    - With reranking: 100-300ms
    - With LLM generation: 500-2000ms

    Enable caching for repeated queries to achieve &lt;10ms latency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Taxonomies & Enrichment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between flat and hierarchical taxonomies?">
    **Flat:** Single-level classification. Each document maps to one or more nodes.
    - Example: Product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home)

    **Hierarchical:** Multi-level tree structure with inheritance.
    - Example: Animal taxonomy (Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order)

    Hierarchical taxonomies require compatible features at each level (e.g., coarse vs fine-grained embeddings).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I use materialized vs on-demand taxonomies?">
    **Materialized (post-ingestion):**
    - Taxonomy stable, changes infrequently
    - Enrichment cost amortized across many queries
    - Low-latency retrieval required

    **On-demand (query-time):**
    - Taxonomy updates frequently
    - Personalized enrichment per query
    - Cost-sensitive (only pay when enrichment used)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update a taxonomy without reprocessing documents?">
    Yes, for minor changes:
    1. Create a new taxonomy version
    2. Update collection's `taxonomy_applications` to reference new version
    3. New queries use updated taxonomy; existing documents unchanged

    For major changes (e.g., new hierarchy levels), reprocess affected collections.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Namespaces & Multi-Tenancy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need multiple namespaces?">
    Use separate namespaces for:
    - **Multi-tenancy:** Isolate customer data
    - **Environments:** dev, staging, production
    - **Access control:** Restrict team/service access

    Single namespace is sufficient for simple use cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can namespaces share collections?">
    No. Collections are namespace-scoped. To share data across namespaces:
    1. Replicate objects to both namespaces
    2. Process into identical collections
    3. Query via namespace-specific retrievers

    **Enterprise:** Contact us for cross-namespace join capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the performance impact of many namespaces?">
    Minimal. Namespaces map 1:1 to Qdrant collections, which are optimized for isolation. Overhead is primarily storage (each namespace has its own vectors/payloads).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost & Billing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are credits calculated?">
    Credits are consumed by:
    - **Document creation:** 1 credit per document
    - **Inference:** 1-500 credits depending on model (embeddings, LLMs, OCR)
    - **Search:** 0.1-10 credits per query (vector search, web search)
    - **Storage:** 100 credits per GB/month

    See [Rate Limits & Quotas](/operations/rate-limits-quotas) for full breakdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do cached results consume credits?">
    No. Cache hits are free. This includes:
    - Retriever-level caching
    - Stage-level caching
    - Document reads (after initial creation)

    **Optimization tip:** Aggressive caching can reduce costs by 5-10x.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my credit quota?">
    Operations are blocked until:
    1. Monthly quota resets (1st of month)
    2. You upgrade tier
    3. You purchase additional credits

    Set up alerts at 80% usage:
    ```bash
    POST /v1/organizations/webhooks
    {
      "event_types": ["usage.threshold_exceeded"],
      "filters": { "threshold_percentage": 80 }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund for unused credits?">
    Credits are non-refundable but roll over month-to-month within the same tier. Downgrades forfeit unused credits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
