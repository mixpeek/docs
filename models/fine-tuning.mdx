    - Regulatory requirements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fine-Tuning Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Annotated Data">
    Upload your training data to a designated S3 bucket. Data should include:
    
    - Positive examples (good matches)
    - Negative examples (poor matches)
    - Relevance scores
    - Content pairs with similarity annotations

    Our team will provide detailed specifications for your use case.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initiate Fine-Tuning">
    Use the Mixpeek Dashboard to schedule a fine-tuning job:

    ```json
    {
      "base_model_id": "multimodal",
      "training_data": "s3://your-bucket/training-data",
      "specs": {
        "epochs": 10,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "learning_rate": 2e-5,
        "loss_function": "contrastive"
      }
    }
    ```

    This returns a new `model_id` (e.g., `model_1askdh2390`) for use in your API calls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version Control">
    Track model versions in your metadata for reproducibility:

    ```json
    {
      "metadata": {
        "model_version": "model_1askdh2390",
        "base_model": "multimodal",
        "training_date": "2024-03-15",
        "description": "Optimized for technical documentation"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
