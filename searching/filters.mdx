Search filters allow you to narrow down results based on specific criteria using logical operators and field conditions.

## Understanding Filters

### Filter Types

1. **Logical Operators**

   - `AND`: All conditions must match
   - `OR`: Any condition can match
   - `NOR`: No conditions should match

2. **Field Operators**
   - `eq`: Exact match
   - `neq`: Not equal
   - `gt`: Greater than
   - `gte`: Greater than or equal
   - `lt`: Less than
   - `lte`: Less than or equal
   - `in`: Value in array
   - `nin`: Value not in array
   - `exists`: Field exists
   - `regex`: Regular expression match

## Filter Structure

### Basic Filter

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "AND": [
      {
        "key": "category",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": "electronics"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Complex Filter

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "case_sensitive": true,
    "AND": [
      {
        "key": "price",
        "operator": "gte",
        "value": 100
      },
      {
        "key": "in_stock",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": true
      }
    ],
    "OR": [
      {
        "key": "category",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": "electronics"
      },
      {
        "key": "category",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": "accessories"
      }
    ],
    "NOR": [
      {
        "key": "status",
        "operator": "eq",
        "value": "discontinued"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- Use indexed fields for filtering
- Combine related conditions under single operators
- Order conditions from most to least selective
- Use appropriate operators for data types

### Common Use Cases

1. **Metadata Filtering**

   - Filter by author, date, status
   - Filter by categories or tags
   - Filter by custom metadata fields

2. **Content Filtering**

   - Filter by content type
   - Filter by content length
   - Filter by content language

3. **Quality Filtering**
   - Filter by confidence scores
   - Filter by relevance thresholds
   - Filter by feature quality metrics

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations

- Only indexed fields can be filtered
- Complex filters may impact performance
- Maximum of 20 conditions per operator
- Nested filters not supported

### Performance Impact

- Each additional filter adds overhead
- Complex regex operations are expensive
- Large IN/NIN arrays affect performance
- Case-sensitive filtering requires more resources

### Data Type Constraints

- Date fields must use ISO 8601 format
- Numeric comparisons require consistent types
- Boolean values must be true/false
- String comparisons are exact by default

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

- Invalid field names
- Unsupported operators
- Type mismatches
- Missing required values

### Resolution Steps

1. Verify field names are correct
2. Check operator compatibility
3. Validate value types
4. Ensure all required fields are present
