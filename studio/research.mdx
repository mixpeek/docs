### Research and debug

- **Ad-hoc retrieval**: Quickly prototype queries against selected retrievers. Tweak inputs, filters, sorts, and grouping to validate pipeline behavior without code.
- **Inspect stage outputs**: Compare per-stage results, scores, and timings to tune parameters.
- **Debug inference**: Call inference backends directly to inspect embeddings and model outputs. API: [Debug Inference](/api-reference/retrievers/debug-inference).
- **Iterate**: Promote successful experiments to saved retrievers and wire them into your apps.

### Tips

- Use small limits and targeted filters while tuning to keep responses fast.
- Validate feature availability in your collections via `Describe Features` before testing embedding stages.
