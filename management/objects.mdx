description: "Work with multimodal objects that contain related files representing a single entity"
---

<Note>
  Objects in Mixpeek represent collections of related files that form a single logical entity, such as a product with images, description, and specifications.
</Note>

## What are Objects?

In Mixpeek, objects are the fundamental units of raw data that you want to process and analyze. An object represents a collection of related files that together form a single logical entity in your domain.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multimodal Containers" icon="box-archive">
    Group related files of different types (images, videos, text, PDFs) into a single logical entity

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File Collections" icon="file-circle-plus">
    Objects can contain multiple files of different types, all representing aspects of the same entity (e.g., product photos, marketing copy, technical specs).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bucket Association" icon="bucket">
    Every object belongs to a specific bucket, which provides organizational structure and access controls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Source" icon="arrow-right">
    When processed by pipelines, objects become the source for one or more documents in collections, with each document maintaining a reference to its source object.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metadata Support" icon="tags">
    Objects can have associated metadata that provides additional context about the entity they represent.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Objects

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create an object with multiple files
  object = mp.objects.create(
      bucket_id="bkt_def456",
      name="product-123",
      metadata={
          "product_id": "123",
          "category": "electronics",
          "brand": "TechCo"
      },
      files=[
          {
              "url": "https://example.com/products/123/main.jpg",
              "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
          },
          {
              "url": "https://example.com/products/123/specs.pdf",
              "mimetype": "application/pdf"
          },
          {
              "url": "https://example.com/products/123/description.txt",
              "mimetype": "text/plain"
          }
      ]
  )
  
  object_id = object["object_id"]
  print(f"Created object: {object_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create an object with multiple files
  const object = await mp.objects.create({
    bucket_id: "bkt_def456",
    name: "product-123",
    metadata: {
      product_id: "123",
      category: "electronics",
      brand: "TechCo"
    },
    files: [
      {
        url: "https://example.com/products/123/main.jpg",
        mimetype: "image/jpeg"
      },
      {
        url: "https://example.com/products/123/specs.pdf",

        url: "https://example.com/products/123/description.txt",
        mimetype: "text/plain"
      }
    ]
  });
  
  const objectId = object.object_id;
  console.log(`Created object: ${objectId}`);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/objects" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{

        }
      ]
    }'
  ```

## Retrieving Objects

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Get a specific object
  object = mp.objects.get(object_id="obj_ghi789")
  
  print(f"Object name: {object['name']}")
  print(f"Files: {len(object['files'])}")
  
  # List all objects in a bucket
  objects = mp.objects.list(bucket_id="bkt_def456")
  
  for obj in objects["objects"]:
      print(f"Object: {obj['name']} (ID: {obj['object_id']})")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Get a specific object
  const object = await mp.objects.get({
    object_id: "obj_ghi789"
  });
  
  console.log(`Object name: ${object.name}`);
  console.log(`Files: ${object.files.length}`);
  
  // List all objects in a bucket
  const objects = await mp.objects.list({
    bucket_id: "bkt_def456"
  });
  
  for (const obj of objects.objects) {
    console.log(`Object: ${obj.name} (ID: ${obj.object_id})`);
  }
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  # Get a specific object
  curl -X GET "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/objects/obj_ghi789" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    
  # List all objects in a bucket
  curl -X GET "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/objects?bucket_id=bkt_def456" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## File References

Files in objects can be referenced in multiple ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="URL Reference">
    ```json
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/path/to/file.jpg",
      "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
    }
    ```
    
    The file is downloaded from the provided URL during processing.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="S3 Reference">
    ```json
    {
      "s3_url": "s3://your-bucket/path/to/file.mp4",
      "mimetype": "video/mp4"
    }
    ```
    
    Direct reference to a file in an S3 bucket (requires proper IAM permissions).
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Base64 Encoding">
    ```json
    {
      "base64": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",
      "filename": "image.png"
    }
    ```
    
    The file content is directly embedded as base64-encoded data.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Processing Objects

After creating an object, you'll typically want to process it using a pipeline:

```python
# Process an object with a pipeline
task = mp.pipelines.run(
    pipeline_id="pl_jkl012",
    object_id="obj_ghi789"
)

task_id = task["task_id"]
print(f"Processing task started: {task_id}")

# Monitor task status
import time
time.sleep(5)  # Wait a bit before checking status

status = mp.tasks.get(task_id=task_id)
print(f"Task status: {status['status']}")
```

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  Objects should represent cohesive entities. Don't create "mega-objects" with unrelated files, as this can impact processing efficiency and data organization.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organize Related Files">
    Group only related files that logically belong together in a single object. For example, different views of the same product or the video, transcript, and slides from a presentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Rich Metadata">
    Add relevant metadata to objects to provide context and enable better filtering and organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify Correct MIME Types">
    Always provide the correct MIME type for each file to ensure proper processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Give objects clear, descriptive names that reflect their content and purpose.
  </Step>
</Steps>
