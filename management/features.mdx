<Note>
  Features are the extracted data elements that represent the content and characteristics of your documents. They are the building blocks that enable advanced search and retrieval capabilities.

## What are Features?

Features in Mixpeek are structured data elements extracted from your content during processing. They represent specific aspects of your data such as:

- Text embeddings
- Image descriptors
- Audio transcriptions
- Video scene information
- PDF content structures
- Detected entities and concepts

## Feature Storage

Features are stored in specialized feature stores optimized for efficient retrieval. Unlike traditional database columns, feature stores are designed to handle:

- High-dimensional vector data
- Efficient similarity searching
- Specialized indexes for multimodal content
- Rapid retrieval of specific feature types

```python
# Example: Retrieving specific features from a document
from mixpeek import Client

client = Client("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Get embeddings feature from a document
embedding = client.documents.get_feature(
    document_id="doc_12345",
    feature_name="text_embedding"
)

# Use the embedding for custom operations
similar_docs = client.collections.search(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    vector=embedding,
    limit=10
)
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # Accessing multiple features from a document
    features = client.documents.get_features(
        document_id="doc_12345",
        feature_names=["text_embedding", "image_objects", "sentiment"]
    )
    
    # Features are returned as a dictionary
    text_embedding = features["text_embedding"]
    detected_objects = features["image_objects"]
    sentiment_score = features["sentiment"]
    
    print(f"Document contains {len(detected_objects)} detected objects")
    print(f"Sentiment score: {sentiment_score}")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // Accessing multiple features from a document
    const features = await client.documents.getFeatures({
      documentId: "doc_12345",
      featureNames: ["text_embedding", "image_objects", "sentiment"]
    });
    
    // Features are returned as an object
    const textEmbedding = features.text_embedding;
    const detectedObjects = features.image_objects;
    const sentimentScore = features.sentiment;
    
    console.log(`Document contains ${detectedObjects.length} detected objects`);
    console.log(`Sentiment score: ${sentimentScore}`);
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/documents/doc_12345/features" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "feature_names": ["text_embedding", "image_objects", "sentiment"]
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Feature Extraction Process

Features are created through feature extractors as part of processing pipelines. This happens in several stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raw Content Analysis">
    Content is analyzed based on its type (text, image, video, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Extraction">
    Specialized extractors process the content to generate features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Normalization">
    Features are normalized into consistent formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Processed features are stored in optimized feature stores
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Feature Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Semantic Search">
    Vector embeddings enable semantic similarity search across your content.
    
    ```python
    # Search using semantic similarity
    results = client.collections.search(
        collection_name="articles",
        query="climate change impacts",
        search_type="semantic",
        limit=10
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content Filtering">
    Use extracted metadata features to filter search results.
    
    ```python
    # Filter by specific features
    filtered_results = client.collections.search(
        collection_name="product_catalog",
        query="laptop",
        filters={
            "price": {"lte": 1000},
            "in_stock": True,
            "categories": {"contains": "electronics"}
        }
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content Recommendation">
    Use feature similarity to recommend related content.
    
    ```python
    # Get similar documents based on features
    similar_products = client.documents.get_similar(
        document_id="product_123",
        collection_name="products",
        feature_name="product_embedding",
        limit=5
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understand Feature Types" icon="lightbulb">
    Different content requires different feature types. Text works well with embeddings, while images need visual descriptors.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Feature Composition" icon="layer-group">
    Combine multiple features for more accurate retrieval. Text + image features provide better results than either alone.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dimension Management" icon="ruler">
    Higher dimensions aren't always better. Balance precision against performance based on your use case.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As your content evolves, consider reprocessing to generate updated features with the latest extractors.
