<Note>
  Features are the extracted data elements that represent the content and characteristics of your documents. They are the building blocks that enable advanced search and retrieval capabilities.
</Note>

## Overview

Features in Mixpeek are structured data elements extracted from your content during processing. They represent specific aspects of your data such as:

- Text embeddings
- Image descriptors
- Audio transcriptions
- Video scene information
- PDF content structures
- Detected entities and concepts

## Feature Extractors

Extractors are pre-built pipelines that have defined input and output schemas. Each extractor runs in parallel within a collection (in a queue). These extractors have optional parameters that can be configured when the collection is defined.

### Extraction Process

Features are created through feature extractors as part of processing pipelines. This happens in several stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raw Content Analysis">
    Content is analyzed based on its type (text, image, video, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Extraction">
    Specialized extractors process the content to generate features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Normalization">
    Features are normalized into consistent formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Processed features are stored in optimized feature stores
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Feature Storage

Features are stored in specialized feature stores optimized for efficient retrieval. Unlike traditional database columns, feature stores are designed to handle:

- High-dimensional vector data
- Efficient similarity searching
- Specialized indexes for multimodal content
- Rapid retrieval of specific feature types

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understand Feature Types" icon="lightbulb">
    Different content requires different feature types. Text works well with embeddings, while images need visual descriptors.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Feature Composition" icon="layer-group">
    Combine multiple features within multiple retrieval stages for more accurate retrieval. Text + image features provide better results than either alone.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As your content evolves, consider reprocessing to generate updated features with the latest extractors.

## Limitations

- **Extraction Time:** Complex feature extraction on large media files may require extended processing time
- **Model Specificity:** Features are tied to the specific model version used during extraction
- **Storage Limits:** Feature stores have capacity limits based on your account tier
- **Update Constraints:** Features cannot be selectively updated; re-extraction of the entire document is required
- **Processing Dependencies:** Feature extraction depends on the availability of third-party models and services
- **Cross-Feature Compatibility:** Not all feature types can be directly compared or combined in search operations
- **Format Support:** Some specialized formats may have limited feature extraction capabilities
