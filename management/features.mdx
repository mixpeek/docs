<Note>
  Features are the extracted data elements that represent the content and characteristics of your documents. They are the building blocks that enable advanced search and retrieval capabilities.
</Note>

## Overview

Features in Mixpeek are structured data elements extracted from your content during processing. They represent specific aspects of your data such as:

- Text embeddings
- Image descriptors
- Audio transcriptions
- Video scene information
- PDF content structures
- Detected entities and concepts

## Feature Extractors

Extractors are pre-built pipelines that have defined input and output schemas. Each extractor runs in parallel within a collection (in a queue). These extractors have optional parameters that can be configured when the collection is defined. 

<Tip>
  Feature extraction in Mixpeek often follows a similar pattern to pandas' `group_by` operation (split, aggregate, merge). Just as pandas splits data into groups, applies operations, and combines results, feature extractors often have the ability to splits content by some characteristic, extracts relevant features, and merges them for unified retrieval.

### Extraction Process

Features are created through feature extractors as part of processing pipelines. This happens in several stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Raw Content Analysis">
    Content is analyzed based on its type (text, image, video, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Extraction">
    Specialized extractors process the content to generate features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feature Normalization">
    Features are normalized into consistent formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Processed features are stored in optimized feature stores
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Feature Storage

Features are stored in specialized feature stores optimized for efficient retrieval. Unlike traditional database columns, feature stores are designed to handle:

- High-dimensional vector data
- Efficient similarity searching
- Specialized indexes for multimodal content
- Rapid retrieval of specific feature types

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Understand Feature Types" icon="lightbulb">
    Different content requires different feature types. Text works well with embeddings, while images need visual descriptors.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Feature Composition" icon="layer-group">
    Combine multiple features within multiple retrieval stages for more accurate retrieval. Text + image features provide better results than either alone.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Updates" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As your content evolves, consider reprocessing to generate updated features with the latest extractors.

## Limitations

- **Extraction Time:** Complex feature extraction on large media files may require extended processing time
- **Model Specificity:** Features are tied to the specific model version used during extraction
- **Storage Limits:** Feature stores have capacity limits based on your account tier
- **Update Constraints:** Features cannot be selectively updated; re-extraction of the entire document is required
- **Processing Dependencies:** Feature extraction depends on the availability of third-party models and services
- **Cross-Feature Compatibility:** Not all feature types can be directly compared or combined in search operations
- **Format Support:** Some specialized formats may have limited feature extraction capabilities
