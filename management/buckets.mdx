<Note>
  Buckets are the foundation of Mixpeek's storage architecture. They serve as containers for raw objects and their associated files before processing.
</Note>

## What are Buckets?

Buckets in Mixpeek are specialized storage containers designed for efficiently managing and organizing your raw multimodal content. They hold objects (collections of related files) before they're processed by pipelines.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Storage Containers" icon="bucket">
    Securely store raw objects and their associated files in logically grouped containers

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Namespace Association" icon="link">
    Each bucket belongs to a specific namespace, inheriting its configuration and security settings. Buckets cannot span multiple namespaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Object Storage" icon="box-archive">
    Buckets store objects, which are collections of related files representing a single entity (e.g., a product with images, specs, and descriptions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pipeline Integration" icon="gears">
    Buckets serve as input sources for processing pipelines, which extract features from the objects and create structured documents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Access Control" icon="lock">
    Buckets inherit the access controls of their parent namespace but can also have bucket-specific access policies.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating a Bucket

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create a bucket
  bucket = mp.buckets.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="product-images",
      description="Product images for e-commerce catalog"
  )
  
  bucket_id = bucket["bucket_id"]
  print(f"Created bucket: {bucket_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create a bucket
  const bucket = await mp.buckets.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "product-images",
    description: "Product images for e-commerce catalog"
  });
  
  const bucketId = bucket.bucket_id;
  console.log(`Created bucket: ${bucketId}`);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/buckets" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "namespace_id": "ns_abc123",
      "name": "product-images",
      "description": "Product images for e-commerce catalog"
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Listing Buckets

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # List all buckets in a namespace
  buckets = mp.buckets.list(namespace_id="ns_abc123")
  
  for bucket in buckets["buckets"]:
      print(f"Bucket: {bucket['name']} (ID: {bucket['bucket_id']})")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // List all buckets in a namespace
  const buckets = await mp.buckets.list({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123"
  });
  
  for (const bucket of buckets.buckets) {
    console.log(`Bucket: ${bucket.name} (ID: ${bucket.bucket_id})`);
  }
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/buckets?namespace_id=ns_abc123" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Objects in Buckets

Once you've created a bucket, you can add objects to it. Objects are collections of related files that represent a single entity in your domain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Object">
    Create an object in your bucket. Each object can contain multiple related files.
    
    ```python
    # Create an object with multiple files
    object = mp.objects.create(
        bucket_id=bucket_id,
        name="red-sneaker-product",
        files=[
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-front.jpg",
                "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
            },
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-side.jpg",
                "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
            },
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/data/red-sneaker-specs.txt",
                "mimetype": "text/plain"
            }
        ]
    )
    
    object_id = object["object_id"]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Process the Object">
    Process the object using a pipeline to extract features.
    
    ```python
    # Process the object with a pipeline
    task = mp.pipelines.run(
        pipeline_id="pl_xyz789",
        object_id=object_id
    )
    
    task_id = task["task_id"]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track Processing Status">
    Monitor the status of the processing task.
    
    ```python
    # Check task status
    status = mp.tasks.get(task_id=task_id)
    print(f"Task status: {status['status']}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
