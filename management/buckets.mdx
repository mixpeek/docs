<Note>
  Buckets are the foundation of Mixpeek's storage architecture. They serve as containers for raw objects and their associated files before processing. They are your entry point for all multimodal processing, search and analysis.

## What are Buckets?

Buckets in Mixpeek are specialized storage containers designed for efficiently managing and organizing your raw multimodal content. They hold blobs (collections of related files or json-types) before they're processed by pipelines.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Storage Containers" icon="bucket">
    Securely store raw objects and their associated files in logically grouped containers

  <Card title="Object Organization" icon="folder-tree">

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Namespace Association" icon="link">
    Each bucket belongs to a specific namespace, inheriting its configuration and security settings. Buckets cannot span multiple namespaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Object Storage" icon="box-archive">
    Buckets store objects, which are collections of related files representing a single entity (e.g., a product with images, specs, and descriptions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collection Integration" icon="gears">
    Buckets serve as input sources for collections, which extract features from the objects and create structured documents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prefixes" icon="lock">
    Buckets inherit the access controls of their parent namespace but can also have prefixes that are used when searching.
  </Accordion>

## Creating a Bucket

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create a bucket
  bucket = mp.buckets.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="product-images",
      description="Product images for e-commerce catalog"
  )
  
  bucket_id = bucket["bucket_id"]
  print(f"Created bucket: {bucket_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create a bucket
  const bucket = await mp.buckets.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "product-images",
    description: "Product images for e-commerce catalog"
  });
  
  const bucketId = bucket.bucket_id;
  console.log(`Created bucket: ${bucketId}`);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/buckets" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "namespace_id": "ns_abc123",
      "name": "product-images",
      "description": "Product images for e-commerce catalog"
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Objects

Once you've created a bucket, you can add objects to it. Objects are collections of related blobs that represent a single entity in your domain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Object">
    Create an object in your bucket. Each object can contain multiple related files.
    
    ```python
    # Create an object with multiple files
    object = mp.objects.create(
        bucket_id=bucket_id,
        name="red-sneaker-product",
        blobs=[
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-front.jpg",
                "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
            },
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-side.jpg",
                "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
            },
            {
                "url": "https://example.com/data/red-sneaker-specs.txt",
                "mimetype": "text/plain"
            }
        ]
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Processing Status">
    Monitor the status of the processing task.
    
    ```python
    # Check task status
    status = mp.tasks.get(task_id=task_id)
    print(f"Task status: {status['status']}")
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Logical Grouping" icon="boxes-stacked">
    Group objects in buckets based on logical collections, such as product categories, content types, or processing requirements
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Naming Conventions" icon="tag">
    Use consistent naming patterns for buckets to make them easily identifiable and manageable
  </Card>

  <Card title="Metadata Usage" icon="route">
    Align bucket structure with your processing pipelines for more efficient workflow organization
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Resource Optimization" icon="gauge-high">
    Monitor bucket usage and distribute objects across multiple buckets if needed for performance optimization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="E-commerce Products" icon="shopping-cart">
    Store product images, videos, specs, and descriptions for catalog processing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Media Assets" icon="photo-film">
    Organize images, videos, and audio files for media libraries

## Blobs

<Note>
  Blobs represent individual files within Objects. While Objects group related files together, Blobs are the actual raw file content that gets processed by feature extractors.
