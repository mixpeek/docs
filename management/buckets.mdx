description: "Store and organize raw multimodal data objects for processing"

<Note>
  Buckets are the foundation of Mixpeek's storage architecture. They serve as containers for raw objects and their associated files before processing. They are your entry point for all multimodal processing, search and analysis.
</Note>

## Overview

Buckets accept objects which are composed of blobs (collections of related files or json-types) before they're processed by collections into documents.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Bucket Schema">
    First, create a bucket with a schema that defines what types of files your objects will contain. This schema validation ensures data consistency and proper processing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Blobs">
    Gather the files (blobs) you want to include in your object. These can be images, videos, documents, audio files, or JSON data that are related to each other.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Blobs as Object">
    Bundle your selected blobs into an object and upload it to your bucket. You can include object metadata and organize with prefixes for better structure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schema Validation" icon="brackets-curly">
    When creating your bucket, you specify the schema that all objects must adhere to. This is strictly enforced. Objects that fail this schema validation will not be processed. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Object Prefixes" icon="lock">
    When uploading an object you can choose to include a prefix which is used as a path. Additionally, individual blobs in the object can maintain their own prefix. 
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Creating a Bucket

```python Python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Create a bucket
bucket = mp.buckets.create(
    namespace="ns_abc123",
    bucket_name="product-images",
    description="Product images for e-commerce catalog",
    schema={
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "video_1": {
          "type": "video"
        },
        "pdf_1": {
          "type": "pdf"
        }
      }
    }
)

bucket_id = bucket["bucket_id"]
print(f"Created bucket: {bucket_id}")
```

## Objects

Once you've created a bucket, you can add objects to it. Objects are collections of related blobs that represent a single entity in your domain.

Create an object in your bucket. Each object can contain multiple related files.

```python
# Create an object with multiple files
mp.objects.create(
  bucket=bucket_id,
  prefix="/files",
  # the metadata is passed down each document
  metadata={
    "name": "red-sneaker-product" 
  }
  blobs=[
      {
          "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-front.jpg",
          "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
      },
      {
          "url": "https://example.com/images/red-sneaker-side.jpg",
          "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
      },
      {
          "url": "https://example.com/data/red-sneaker-specs.txt",
          "mimetype": "text/plain"
      }
  ]
)
```

## Blobs

<Note>
  Blobs represent individual files within Objects. While Objects group related files together, Blobs are the actual raw file content or JSON types that gets processed by feature extractors.
</Note>

Once your blobs are processing into objects, they maintain the prefix structure you assigned on upload. They can be treated as a standard file system.

## Limitations

### Bucket Limitations
- **Storage Quotas:** Each namespace has limits on total bucket storage capacity based on your plan
- **Bucket Naming:** Bucket names must be unique within a namespace and follow naming conventions
- **Rate Limits:** API operations on buckets are subject to rate limiting based on your account tier
- **Schema Changes:** Bucket schemas cannot be modified after creation; a new bucket must be created

### Object Limitations
- **Size Restrictions:** Objects have a maximum combined blob size of 10GB per object
- **Metadata Size:** Object metadata is limited to 100KB in size
- **Immutability:** Object structure cannot be modified after creation (blobs cannot be added or removed)
- **Prefix Depth:** Object prefixes are limited to a maximum of 20 levels of nesting

### Blob Limitations
- **Size Constraints:** Maximum blob size varies by file type (see Supported File Types above)
- **Quantity Limits:** Maximum number of blobs per object: 10
- **Format Restrictions:** Supported MIME types are limited to those listed above
- **Content Immutability:** Blob content is immutable once uploaded
