<Note>
  Namespaces act as query boundaries in Mixpeek. They provide isolation between different environments, projects, or clients, ensuring that queries and operations are contained within their intended scope.
</Note>

## Overview

They serve as the highest-level organizational unit, similar to databases in traditional systems. Each namespace maintains its own:

- Buckets and Objects
- Collections and Documents
- Feature Stores
- Retrievers and Pipelines
- Taxonomies and Clusters

When you create a namespace, you select the features you want to make available across the namespace. This is important to select up-front because the features map to index definitions and are immutable. The features you select here limit the feature extractors you have available when you create collections. 

Payload indexes are however mutable, they can be modified whenever. Payload indexes are important to specify in order to ensure your queries remain performant as the contents of your namespace scales. 


## Usage

```python
# Create a namespace
namespace = mp.namespaces.create(
    name="quickstart",
    description="My first Mixpeek project",
    feature_extractors: [
    {
      "feature_extractor_name": "text-extractor",
    }
  ]
)
namespace_id = namespace["namespace_id"]
```

## Best Practices

### Namespace Organization

- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Create separate namespaces for different environments
- Consider data isolation requirements when planning namespace structure
- Document namespace purpose and contents

### Resource Management

- Regularly audit namespace contents
- Clean up unused resources within namespaces
- Monitor namespace usage and quotas
- Implement proper access controls

### Index Mutability

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Vector Indexes">
    Vector indexes are immutable configurations that define how feature vectors (like embeddings) are stored and searched within your namespace. They are:

    - Set during namespace creation
    - Cannot be modified after namespace creation
    - Determine which feature extractors are available
    - Optimize vector similarity search performance
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Payload Indexes">
    Payload indexes are mutable configurations that optimize queries on document fields within your namespace. They:

    - Can be modified at any time
    - Help maintain query performance as your data scales
    - Support efficient filtering and sorting operations
    - Are recommended for frequently queried fields
  </Tab>

## Limitations

- **Maximum Namespace Count:** Maximum number of namespaces per account: 100
- **Namespace Uniqueness:** Namespace names must be unique within your account
- **Naming Constraints:** Namespace names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- **Resource Isolation:** Resources cannot be moved between namespaces
- **Query Boundaries:** Cross-namespace queries are not supported
