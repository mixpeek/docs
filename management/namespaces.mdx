<Note>
  Namespaces act as query boundaries in Mixpeek. They provide isolation between different environments, projects, or clients, ensuring that queries and operations are contained within their intended scope.
</Note>

## Overview

Namespaces are logical containers that help organize and isolate your Mixpeek resources. They serve as the highest-level organizational unit, similar to databases in traditional systems. Each namespace maintains its own:

- Buckets and Objects
- Collections and Documents
- Feature Stores
- Retrievers and Pipelines
- Taxonomies and Clusters

When you create a namespace, you select the features you want to make available across the namespace. This is important to select up-front because the features map to index definitions and are immutable. The features you select here limit the feature extractors you have available when you create collections. 

Payload indexes are however mutable, they can be modified whenever. Payload indexes are important to specify in order to ensure your queries remain performant as the contents of your namespace scales.

  <Card title="Client Isolation" icon="users">
    Separate resources for different clients or projects
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Segregation" icon="database">
    Keep different data domains separate (e.g., marketing vs. product content)
  </Card>

    Manage permissions and access at a high level
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices

#### Namespace Organization

- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Create separate namespaces for different environments
- Consider data isolation requirements when planning namespace structure
- Document namespace purpose and contents

#### Resource Management

- Regularly audit namespace contents
- Clean up unused resources within namespaces
- Monitor namespace usage and quotas
- Implement proper access controls

## Vector Indexes

Vector indexes are immutable configurations that define how feature vectors (like embeddings) are stored and searched within your namespace. They are:
- Set during namespace creation
- Cannot be modified after namespace creation
- Determine which feature extractors are available
- Optimize vector similarity search performance

## Payload Indexes

Payload indexes are mutable configurations that optimize queries on document fields within your namespace. They:
- Can be modified at any time
- Help maintain query performance as your data scales
- Support efficient filtering and sorting operations
- Are recommended for frequently queried fields


## Limitations

- Maximum number of namespaces per account: 100
- Namespace names must be unique within your account
- Namespace names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Resources cannot be moved between namespaces
- Cross-namespace queries are not supported
