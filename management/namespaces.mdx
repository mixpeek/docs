<Note>
  Namespaces act as query boundaries in Mixpeek. They provide isolation between different environments, projects, or clients, ensuring that queries and operations are contained within their intended scope.

## What are Namespaces?

Namespaces are logical containers that help organize and isolate your Mixpeek resources. They serve as the highest-level organizational unit, similar to databases in traditional systems. Each namespace maintains its own:

- Buckets and Objects
- Collections and Documents
- Feature Stores
- Retrievers and Pipelines
- Taxonomies

When you create a namespace, you select the features you want to make available across the namespace. This is important to select up-front because the features map to index definitions and are immutable. The features you select here limit the feature extractors you select when you create collections. 

Payload indexes are however mutable, they can be modified whenever. They are important to specify in order to ensure your queries are performant.

## Best Practices

### Namespace Organization

- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Create separate namespaces for different environments
- Consider data isolation requirements when planning namespace structure
- Document namespace purpose and contents

### Resource Management

- Regularly audit namespace contents
- Clean up unused resources within namespaces
- Monitor namespace usage and quotas
- Implement proper access controls

## Limitations

- Maximum number of namespaces per account: 100
- Namespace names must be unique within your account
- Namespace names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Resources cannot be moved between namespaces
- Cross-namespace queries are not supported
