## Base URL

The Mixpeek API is built on REST principles, enforcing HTTPS in every request to enhance data security, integrity, and privacy. Please note that the API does not support HTTP.

All requests should be directed to the following base URL:

```
https://api.mixpeek.com
```

## Authentication

Our API supports header-based authentication:

### Mixpeek API Key

For API key-based authentication, you can pass in your API key.

```
Content-Type: application/json
authorization: Bearer <API KEY>
```

## Rate Limit

Below are the rate limits (requests per minute) for different API endpoints based on your plan:

| Endpoint      | Free Plan | Pro Plan | Enterprise Plan |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Default       | 10        | 60       | Unlimited       |
| search.text   | 10        | 200      | Unlimited       |
| search.url    | 10        | 120      | Unlimited       |
| search.upload | 10        | 60       | Unlimited       |
| index.text    | 10        | 200      | Unlimited       |
| index.url     | 10        | 120      | Unlimited       |
| index.upload  | 10        | 120      | Unlimited       |

After the rate limit is exceeded, you'll hit the rate limit and receive a `429` response error code. To prevent this, we recommend reducing the rate at which you request the API. This can be done by introducing a queue mechanism or reducing the number of concurrent requests per second. If you have specific requirements, contact support to request a rate increase.

## Response Codes

Mixpeek uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Successful request.                       |
| `400`  | Check that the parameters were correct.   |
| `401`  | User doesn't have access to the resource. |

## FAQ

### How does pagination work with the API?

Every response that returns a list of items is paginated, you can supply `page_size` and `page` in the url parameters. Note, that some list responses (like features) behaves differently for pagination.

### How do you handle API versioning?

Currently, there's no versioning system in place. We plan to add versioning via calendar-based headers in the future.
