title: "Create Pipeline"
description: "This is where your transformations live"
api: "POST /pipelines"
---

Pipelines are the backbone of Mixpeek. It's where you describe how you want the engine to process your objects as they pass through in real-time.

To build a pipeline, you'll need to first have created a `source` and `destination` connection, then add their `connection_id` in the `connections` object.

## Request

<ParamField body="connections" type="object" required>
  Defines the source and destination connection identifiers for the data flow.
  <Field name="source" type="string" required>
    The unique identifier for the data source connection.
  </Field>
  <Field name="destination" type="string" required>
    The unique identifier for the data destination connection.
  </Field>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="code" type="string" required>
  The code, provided as a string, which dictates how the data will be
  transformed during the pipeline process.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Optional metadata to provide context or additional information about the
  pipeline being created.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="pipeline_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the newly created pipeline. This ID can be used to
  reference the pipeline in future operations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enabled" type="boolean" optional>
  Indicates whether the pipeline is enabled upon creation. This can be set to
  true to start processing immediately.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connections" type="object" required>
  Echoes back the source and destination connection IDs provided in the request,
  confirming the data flow paths that have been set up.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Echoes back any metadata provided in the request, confirming the additional
  contextual information associated with the pipeline.
</ResponseField>

```python Python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mixpeek = Mixpeek("API_KEY")


pipeline_id = mixpeek.pipelines.create(
  alias="MyPipeline",
  code="function execute() { return true; }",
  source={
    "connection_id": "conn_456",
    "filters": {
      "foo": "bar"
    }
  },
  destination={
    "connection_id": "conn_431",
    "collection": "data_bucket",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "storage"
    }
  }
)
```
