Interactions are the raw material for relevance engineering. This page covers **signal strategy** — which signals to capture, when, and why. For the API itself, see the [Interactions API reference](/retrieval/interactions).

## Signal Strength Matrix

Not all signals carry equal weight. The table below maps each interaction type to how it's used across the platform:

| Signal Type | Strength | Fusion Learning | Personalization | Analytics | Fine-Tuning |
|-------------|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `click` | Moderate | Primary positive signal | Session history | CTR metrics | Positive pairs |
| `long_view` | Strong | High-weight positive | Preference indicator | Engagement depth | Strong positive |
| `purchase` | Strongest | Conversion signal | Purchase exclusion | Revenue attribution | Gold standard |
| `add_to_cart` | Strong | Intent signal | Cart-based recs | Funnel metrics | Near-positive |
| `positive_feedback` | Explicit | Direct reward | Profile building | Quality score | Ground truth |
| `negative_feedback` | Explicit | Direct penalty | Anti-preference | Issue detection | Hard negative |
| `skip` | Weak negative | Implicit penalty | — | Skip rate | Soft negative |
| `return_to_results` | Moderate negative | Bounce signal | — | Bounce rate | Negative pair |
| `share` | Strong | Social proof | Sharing patterns | Virality | Strong positive |
| `bookmark` | Moderate | Save intent | Saved items | Save rate | Positive |
| `copy` | Moderate | Content value | — | Engagement | Positive |
| `dwell_time` | Variable | Duration-weighted | — | Engagement depth | Weighted |
| `scroll_depth` | Weak | Engagement depth | — | Content quality | — |
| `query_refinement` | Negative | Query failure signal | — | Query analysis | — |

## Use Case Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="E-commerce">
    **Primary signals:** `purchase`, `add_to_cart`, `click`

    E-commerce prioritizes conversion signals. A purchase is the strongest indicator that a result was relevant.

    ```json
    {
      "feature_id": "doc_product_123",
      "interaction_type": ["purchase"],
      "position": 2,
      "metadata": {
        "order_value": 49.99,
        "query": "wireless earbuds",
        "category": "electronics"
      },
      "user_id": "user_456",
      "session_id": "sess_789"
    }
    ```

    **Key patterns:**
    - Track `add_to_cart` separately from `purchase` to measure funnel drop-off
    - Use `position` for learning-to-rank bias correction
    - Store `order_value` in metadata for revenue-weighted metrics
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Media & Entertainment">
    **Primary signals:** `long_view`, `click`, `share`

    Media platforms care about engagement depth. A video watched to 80% is a stronger signal than a click.

    ```json
    {
      "feature_id": "doc_video_456",
      "interaction_type": ["click", "long_view"],
      "position": 1,
      "metadata": {
        "duration_ms": 45000,
        "completion_pct": 0.82,
        "query": "cooking tutorial"
      },
      "user_id": "user_789"
    }
    ```

    **Key patterns:**
    - Combine `click` and `long_view` in a single event when engagement is sustained
    - Use `duration_ms` and `completion_pct` to distinguish genuine views from bounces
    - Track `share` events as strong positive signals for content quality
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Enterprise Search">
    **Primary signals:** `click`, `positive_feedback`, `bookmark`

    Enterprise search benefits from explicit feedback since clicks alone may indicate obligation rather than satisfaction.

    ```json
    {
      "feature_id": "doc_kb_789",
      "interaction_type": ["positive_feedback"],
      "position": 3,
      "metadata": {
        "query": "PTO policy 2025",
        "department": "engineering"
      },
      "user_id": "user_012"
    }
    ```

    **Key patterns:**
    - Add thumbs-up/down UI to capture explicit feedback
    - Store `department` or `role` in metadata for demographic-level learned fusion
    - Track `query_refinement` to find queries where results aren't meeting expectations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Recommendations">
    **Primary signals:** `click`, `purchase`, `negative_feedback`

    Recommendation systems need both positive and negative signals to avoid recommending disliked content.

    ```json
    {
      "feature_id": "doc_rec_321",
      "interaction_type": ["negative_feedback"],
      "position": 0,
      "metadata": {
        "reason": "not_interested",
        "source": "homepage_feed"
      },
      "user_id": "user_654"
    }
    ```

    **Key patterns:**
    - Capture "not interested" / "hide" as `negative_feedback` to actively suppress similar content
    - Use purchase history to filter already-bought items from results
    - Track position carefully — recommendation position bias is stronger than search
  </Tab>

## Implementation Patterns

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Client-Side (Browser)
// Track clicks with position
document.querySelectorAll('.search-result').forEach((el, index) => {
  el.addEventListener('click', () => {
    fetch('/api/interactions', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        feature_id: el.dataset.documentId,
        interaction_type: ['click'],
        position: index,
        metadata: { query: currentQuery },
        user_id: userId,
        session_id: sessionId
      })
    });
  });
});

// Track dwell time on result detail pages
let startTime = Date.now();
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  const dwellMs = Date.now() - startTime;
  navigator.sendBeacon('/api/interactions', JSON.stringify({
    feature_id: currentDocId,
    interaction_type: dwellMs > 5000 ? ['click', 'long_view'] : ['click'],
    position: resultPosition,
    metadata: { duration_ms: dwellMs, query: originalQuery },
    user_id: userId
  }));
});
```

```python Server-Side (Python)
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

client = Mixpeek(api_key="your-api-key")

# Record a purchase event server-side
client.retrievers.interactions.create(
    feature_id="doc_product_123",
    interaction_type=["purchase", "click"],
    position=2,
    metadata={
        "order_id": "ord_456",
        "order_value": 49.99,
        "query": original_query
    },
    user_id=user_id,
    session_id=session_id
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Position Tracking

<Warning>
  **Always capture `position`.** Without position data, the system cannot correct for position bias — the tendency for users to click higher-ranked results regardless of relevance. This is critical for both learned fusion and fine-tuning.
</Warning>

Position bias correction works by comparing the click-through rate at each position against the expected baseline. A click at position 8 is a much stronger relevance signal than a click at position 1, because users are less likely to scroll that far.

## Cold Start Considerations

When you first deploy, you have zero interactions. Here's what happens at each stage:

| Interactions | Fusion Behavior | What To Do |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 0 | Falls back to `rrf` (uniform weights) | Ship with `rrf`, start collecting signals |
| 1–50 | Global-level learned weights only | Monitor analytics for obvious issues |
| 50–500 | Demographic-level personalization begins | Verify evaluation metrics are trending up |
| 500+ | Per-user personalization kicks in | Run benchmarks to compare against baseline |

The system handles this automatically through the [hierarchical fallback](/relevance/learned-fusion#hierarchical-fallback) in Thompson Sampling: personal context (if enough data) → demographic context → global context → uniform prior.
