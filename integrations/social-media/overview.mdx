<Note>
  Social media integrations allow you to monitor and analyze public media from other accounts using platform APIs. Mixpeek handles authentication, media download, and processing automatically.
</Note>

Social media platforms are rich sources of multimodal content — images, videos, carousels, and metadata like captions, engagement metrics, and timestamps. By connecting Mixpeek to social media APIs, you can build brand monitoring, competitive analysis, and content intelligence pipelines without manual data collection.

## How It Works

Social media integrations use a **connection + sync config** architecture:

1. **Connection** — Authenticates with the platform via OAuth. One connection provides API access through your authenticated account.
2. **Sync Configs** — Each sync config targets a specific account to monitor. One connection can have many sync configs, each pointing at a different account.
3. **Sync Execution** — When triggered, Mixpeek fetches media from the target account, downloads content to your bucket (S3/LocalStack), and creates bucket objects with metadata.
4. **Processing** — Bucket objects flow through your collection pipeline for feature extraction, embedding generation, and indexing — just like any other data source.

```
Connection (OAuth)
    ├── Sync Config: @nike       → Bucket Objects → Collection → Documents
    ├── Sync Config: @adidas     → Bucket Objects → Collection → Documents
    └── Sync Config: @spotify    → Bucket Objects → Collection → Documents
```

## Getting Started

1. **Authenticate** — Create a connection by completing the OAuth flow for your chosen platform.
2. **Add Accounts** — Create sync configs for each account you want to monitor.
3. **Trigger Sync** — Run an initial sync to pull media into your bucket.
4. **Process** — Set up a collection with a feature extractor to generate embeddings and index the content.
5. **Retrieve** — Build retrievers to search across your synced social media content.
