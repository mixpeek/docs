Features are the model outputs produced when collections run their configured extractors. They live inside documents, power retrieval and enrichment, and are always referenced with a stable URI.

## Feature URIs

```
mixpeek://{extractor_name}@{version}/{output_name}
```

Examples:

- `mixpeek://text_extractor@v1/text_embedding`
- `mixpeek://clip_vit_l_14@v1/image_embedding`
- `mixpeek://splade_extractor@v1/splade_vector`
- `mixpeek://colbert_extractor@v1/colbert_embeddings`

Use feature URIs when:

- Defining retriever stages (`feature_address`)
- Configuring taxonomy input mappings
- Building clustering jobs
- Inspecting collection output schemas

## Feature Anatomy

Documents store features as regular fields plus vector payloads:

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_123",
  "collection_id": "col_products",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "audio",
    "brand": "Acme"
  },
  "text_extractor_v1_embedding": [0.12, 0.03, ...],
  "splade_extractor_v1_vector": {
    "indices": [345, 912],
    "values": [0.82, 0.54]
  },
  "clip_vit_l_14_v1_embedding": [0.09, 0.41, ...],
  "source_blobs": [...],
  "internal_metadata": {
    "processing_history": [...]
  }
}
```

Vector fields are automatically written to Qdrant as named vectors; payload fields stay in MongoDB and Qdrant payloads for filtering and enrichment.

## Inspect Available Features

- `GET /v1/collections/{collection_id}` – returns the deterministic `output_schema`.
- `GET /v1/collections/{collection_id}/features` – enumerates feature URIs, dimensions, and metadata.
- `GET /v1/feature-extractors` – discover available extractors, versions, and output fields.

## Feature Types

| Extractor | Feature Type | Typical Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `text_extractor` | Dense embedding (1024–1536 dims) | Semantic text search |
| `splade_extractor` | Sparse vector (indices + weights) | Lexical / hybrid search |
| `colbert_extractor` | Multi-vector (per-token) | Late interaction search |
| `clip_vit_l_14` | Dense multimodal embedding | Image & text similarity |
| `video_extractor` | Scene embeddings + metadata | Video retrieval & analytics |
| `whisper_large_v3` | Transcription + timestamps | Audio search & diarization |

Refer to [Feature Extractors](/processing/feature-extractors) for full schemas and parameters.

## Working with Feature URIs

```json
{
  "stage_name": "knn_search",
  "version": "v1",
  "parameters": {
    "feature_address": "mixpeek://text_extractor@v1/text_embedding",
    "input_mapping": { "text": "query_text" },
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

Taxonomy example:

```json
{
  "taxonomy_type": "flat",
  "retriever_id": "ret_face_matcher",
  "input_mappings": {
    "query_embedding": "mixpeek://face_detector@v2/face_embedding"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version carefully** – upgrading an extractor version creates new feature URIs. Re-index collections or create new ones for breaking changes.
2. **Name consistently** – stick to canonical URIs in retrievers and enrichment jobs to avoid mismatches.
3. **Store passthrough metadata** – combine features with metadata fields (category, locale) for precise filters and joins.
4. **Monitor extractor performance** – Analytics endpoints (`/v1/analytics/extractors/performance`) help validate throughput and latency.
5. **Leverage inference caching** – repeated calls to the same feature URI benefit from the Engine’s inference cache.

With feature URIs, you always know which model (and version) populated a document field, ensuring queries remain compatible with ingestion pipelines.
