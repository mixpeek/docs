description: "Model outputs stored inside documents for retrieval"

<Note>
  Features are fields inside documents produced by feature extractors. They include vectors and payload attributes that power retrieval, enrichment, and analytics.
</Note>

## Overview

- **Where features live**: Inside collection documents (not standalone). Documents are written by extractors during processing.
- **What features are**: Model outputs such as vectors (dense/sparse/multi) and structured payload fields.
- **Configured by**: The collection’s feature extractors and index definitions.

## Feature anatomy (in a document)

A document stores features as payload fields and vectors. Exact paths depend on the collection’s extractor configuration and feature addresses.

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_123",
  "collection_id": "col_products_v1",
  "metadata": {"category": "shoes"},
  "features": {
    "text_embedding": {"vector": [0.12, 0.03, ...]},
    "clip_image": {"vector": [0.09, 0.41, ...]},
    "entities": ["shoe", "sneaker"],
    "title": "Red Sneaker"
  }
}
```

- Vectors are stored under configured vector field names and indexed per the collection’s vector indexes.
- Non-vector outputs (payload) are stored as normal document fields under `features` or other configured paths.

## Describe features for a collection

Get feature addresses and metadata available in a collection.

- **API**: Describe Collection Features
- **Method**: GET
- **Path**: `/v1/collections/{collection_identifier}/features`
- **Reference**: [API Reference](/api-reference/collections/describe-collection-features)

## Discover feature extractors

Browse supported extractors and their input/output schemas.

- **List Extractors**: [API Reference](/api-reference/feature-extractors/list-feature-extractors)
- **Get Extractor by Name**: [API Reference](/api-reference/feature-extractors/get-feature-extractor-by-name)

## Used by

- **Retrievers**: Execute vector/payload search over features in documents ([Retrievers](/retrieval/retrievers)).
- **Taxonomies**: Join/enrich using configured feature fields ([Taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies)).
- **Clusters**: Build similarity groups over feature vectors ([Clusters](/enrichment/clusters)).

## Best practices

- **Pick extractors per modality**: Text, images, audio, and video often need different models.
- **Version your models**: Prefer new collections or reprocessing when changing model versions.
- **Name feature fields clearly**: Stable field names simplify retriever and taxonomy configs.
