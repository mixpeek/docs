description: "Store processed documents with consistent schemas for retrieval"
---

<Note>
  Collections are where processed documents live. They define how outputs are stored after feature extraction and serve as the main retrieval surface.
</Note>

## Overview

- **What they store**: Structured documents produced by feature extractors.
- **Inputs**: Typically ingest from a bucket (raw objects) or another collection.
- **Consistency**: All documents in a collection share a schema determined by configured feature extractors.
- **Retrieval**: Retrievers query one or more collections to return ranked results.

## Collection model

Minimum fields when creating a collection. See the endpoint at [Create Collection](/api-reference/collections/create-collection).

```json
{
  "collection_name": "products_v1",
  "description": "Product catalog (images + text)",
  "source": {"type": "BUCKET", "bucket_id": "bkt_123"},
  "feature_extractors": [
    {
      "feature_extractor_name": "gte_modernbert_base",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {"env": "prod"}
}
```

- `source.type`: `BUCKET` or `COLLECTION`.
- `feature_extractors`: Which models generate vectors/fields for documents.
- `metadata`: User-defined metadata attached to the collection record.

## Create a collection

- API: Create Collection
- Method: POST
- Path: `/v1/collections`
- Reference: [API Reference](/api-reference/collections/create-collection)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/collections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Namespace: ns_123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "collection_name": "products_v1",
    "description": "Product catalog (images + text)",
    "source": {"type": "BUCKET", "bucket_id": "bkt_123"},
    "feature_extractors": [
      {"feature_extractor_name": "gte_modernbert_base", "version": "1.0.0"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Describe available features

List configured feature addresses and metadata for a collection.

- **API**: Describe Collection Features
- **Method**: GET
- **Path**: `/v1/collections/{collection_identifier}/features`
- **Reference**: [API Reference](/api-reference/collections/describe-collection-features)

## Manage collections

- [Get Collection](/api-reference/collections/get-collection)
- [Update Collection](/api-reference/collections/update-collection)
- [Delete Collection](/api-reference/collections/delete-collection)
- [List Collections](/api-reference/collections/list-collections)

## Documents in collections

Documents are created by pipelines and stored in the target collection. Use Collection Documents APIs to read/update.

- [Get a Document by ID](/api-reference/collection-documents/get-a-document-by-id)
- [Update Document](/api-reference/collection-documents/update-document)
- [Delete a Document by ID](/api-reference/collection-documents/delete-a-document-by-id)
- [List Documents](/api-reference/collection-documents/list-documents)
- [Create a Document](/api-reference/collection-documents/create-a-document)

## Used by

- [Retrievers](/retrieval/retrievers): Query collections for search results.
- [Taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies): Enrich documents using similarity joins; configured against collection IDs.
- [Clusters](/enrichment/clusters): Build and analyze clusters over vectors from one or more collections.

## Behavior & validation

- **Schema**: Determined by feature extractor outputs; documents must conform.
- **Lineage**: Documents maintain references to the source object and processing metadata.
- **Enablement**: Collections can be enabled/disabled via the update endpoint.
