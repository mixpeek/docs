  ## Taxonomies and Clustering

  Introducing powerful taxonomies to organize and classify your content using multimodal AI. Create hierarchical categories that understand both text and images, enabling intelligent content organization at scale.

  ### Key Features
  * **Flexible Hierarchy** - Build nested categories with independent node matching and confidence scoring
  * **Multimodal Support** - Define taxonomy nodes using text, images, or both
  * **Test-Driven Development** - Validate taxonomies on sample data before production deployment
  * **Automated Classification** - Automatically categorize new content during ingestion
  * **Manual Controls** - Override or supplement AI classifications with manual assignments
