title: "Vector Indexes"

Vector indexes are specialized data structures that enable efficient similarity search across your content embeddings. They are optimized for different modalities and vector types in our model registry.

## Understanding Vector Indexes

### Key Concepts

- **Vector Space**: Multidimensional space where content is represented, with dimensions varying by model (512-1408)
- **Modality Support**: Different indexes optimized for specific content types (text, image, video, audio)
- **Vector Types**: Support for both dense and sparse embeddings
- **Performance Tradeoffs**: Balance between speed and accuracy

## Available Index Types

### 1. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

Best for:

- Dense vectors from our image (512d), text (1024d), and multimodal (1408d) models
- Real-time search applications
- Large-scale datasets

### 2. SPLADE (Sparse Lexical AnD Expansion)

Best for:

- Sparse vectors from our keyword model
- Text-specific search
- Interpretable results

### 3. Flat Index

Best for:

- Small datasets
- Exact search requirements
- Development/testing
- Maximum accuracy needed
