Features are the extracted data points and characteristics from your content that enable advanced search and analysis capabilities. Mixpeek automatically extracts features from your assets using state-of-the-art AI models.

## Understanding Features

### Key Concepts

- **Feature Types**: Different kinds of extracted information
- **Extraction Process**: How features are generated
- **Feature Storage**: How features are stored and indexed
- **Feature Usage**: How features enable search and analysis

## Feature Types

### Text Features

- **Embeddings**: Vector representations of text
- **Keywords**: Important terms and phrases
- **Entities**: Named entities (people, places, organizations)
- **Topics**: Subject matter categorization
- **Sentiment**: Emotional tone analysis

### Image Features

- **Visual Embeddings**: Vector representations of images
- **Objects**: Detected objects and their locations
- **Scenes**: Environmental context
- **Colors**: Color schemes and patterns
- **Text (OCR)**: Extracted text from images
- **Faces**: Detected and recognized faces

### Video Features

- **Frame Features**: Per-frame analysis
- **Motion**: Movement and activity detection
- **Audio**: Speech and sound analysis
- **Temporal**: Time-based patterns
- **Scene Changes**: Scene transition detection

## Best Practices

### Extraction Configuration

1. **Selective Extraction**

   - Extract only needed features
   - Consider processing costs
   - Balance accuracy vs. speed
   - Use appropriate confidence thresholds

2. **Quality Control**
   - Validate extraction results
   - Monitor confidence scores
   - Handle edge cases
   - Regular quality checks

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Extract features in batches
- **Caching**: Cache frequent features
- **Resource Management**: Monitor usage
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Efficient extraction order

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

- **Extraction Failures**: Processing errors
- **Quality Issues**: Low confidence scores
- **Resource Limits**: Processing constraints
- **Invalid Input**: Unsupported content

### Resolution

1. **Validation**

   - Check input quality
   - Verify content types
   - Monitor extraction process
   - Validate results

2. **Recovery**
   - Implement retries
   - Use fallback extractors
   - Log failures
   - Alert on issues
