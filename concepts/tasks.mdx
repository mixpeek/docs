Tasks in Mixpeek represent asynchronous operations that may take time to complete, such as content processing, feature extraction, and index building. The task system helps you manage and monitor these long-running operations.

## Understanding Tasks

### Key Concepts

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress and completion
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures and retries
- **Resource Management**: Control concurrent operations

## Task Types

### Common Tasks

1. **Content Processing**

   - Feature extraction
   - Asset indexing
   - Batch operations
   - Model training

2. **System Operations**
   - Index building
   - Collection updates
   - Data migrations
   - Maintenance tasks

### Task Statuses

Tasks can have the following statuses:

- `INITIALIZING`: Task is being set up
- `DOWNLOADING`: Content is being downloaded
- `PROCESSING`: Task is actively being processed
- `DONE`: Task completed successfully
- `FAILED`: Task encountered an error and could not complete
