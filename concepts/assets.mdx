Assets are the individual pieces of content that you index and search in Mixpeek. They can be text, images, videos, or any other supported content type. Each asset is processed to extract features and make it searchable.

## Understanding Assets

### Key Concepts

- **Content Types**: Different types of media content
- **Feature Extraction**: Automated processing and analysis
- **Metadata**: Additional information about assets
- **Lifecycle Management**: Asset creation to deletion

## Asset Types

### Supported Content

1. **Text**

   - Documents
   - Articles
   - Product descriptions
   - Social media posts

2. **Images**

   - Product photos
   - User uploads
   - Marketing materials
   - Artwork

3. **Videos**
   - Product demos
   - Tutorial content
   - Marketing videos
   - User-generated content

## Best Practices

### Asset Organization

1. **Metadata Structure**

   - Use consistent schemas
   - Include relevant information
   - Keep metadata current
   - Enable efficient filtering

2. **Content Management**
   - Validate content quality
   - Use appropriate formats
   - Optimize file sizes
   - Maintain content freshness

### Performance Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple assets together
- **Efficient Updates**: Use partial updates when possible
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently accessed assets
- **Resource Management**: Monitor storage and processing

### Asset URL Management

When retrieving assets, Mixpeek provides secure, temporary access through presigned URLs. This is controlled through the `return_url` parameter:

- **Presigned URLs**: Temporary, secure URLs that grant time-limited access to assets
- **Access Control**: Ensures assets are only accessible to authorized users
- **Security**: URLs automatically expire after a set period
- **Performance**: Enables direct asset downloads from storage without proxy routing

`return_url` is a parameter available in all `/assets` and `/features` retrieval endpoints.

#### Benefits

1. **Security**

   - Controlled access to sensitive assets
   - No need to expose permanent storage URLs
   - Automatic expiration reduces security risks

2. **Performance**

   - Direct downloads from storage providers
   - Reduced server load
   - Optimized for large files and media

3. **Flexibility**
   - Time-limited access for temporary sharing
   - Works with various storage backends
   - Supports both public and private assets
