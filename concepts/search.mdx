# Search in Mixpeek

Mixpeek provides powerful and flexible search capabilities that allow you to find exactly what you need across your data. Let's explore the different types of search and how they can benefit your application.

## Understanding Search Types

### Feature Search

Feature search allows you to find specific pieces of information within your extracted features. This is particularly powerful when you want to:

- Find specific text passages within documents
- Locate particular objects within images
- Search through transcribed audio content
- Find specific patterns in structured data

For example, if you've processed documents and images, you could search for "red car in parking lot" and find all images containing that scene, or search for "revenue projections" to find relevant sections in financial documents.

### Asset Search

Asset search operates at the whole-file level, allowing you to find entire assets based on their overall content and metadata. This is useful when you want to:

- Find similar documents or media files
- Discover related content across your dataset
- Group similar assets together
- Find assets based on their overall characteristics

For instance, you could find all presentations similar to a specific sales deck, or locate images that share similar visual themes.

## Search Capabilities

### Semantic Search

Mixpeek uses advanced embedding models to understand the meaning behind your queries, not just matching keywords. This means:

- Natural language queries work out of the box
- Results are ranked by relevance and semantic similarity
- Search works across different ways of expressing the same concept

### Multi-Modal Search

You can search across different types of content seamlessly:

- Text documents
- Images
- Audio files
- Video content
- Structured data

### Filtered Search

Combine semantic search with traditional filters:

- Filter by metadata (date, size, type)
- Filter by specific feature types
- Filter by namespaces or collections
- Combine multiple filters for precise results

## Best Practices

### Query Formulation

- Be specific in your queries
- Use natural language
- Consider the context of your search
- Use filters to narrow down results

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate index settings
- Consider namespace organization
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Cache frequently accessed results
