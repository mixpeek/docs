Visual discovery is the process of finding visually similar items to a given image or video. This is useful for a variety of use cases, such as:

- **E-commerce**: recommend visually similar products to a user
- **Content moderation**: detect inappropriate content in images and videos
- **Media analytics**: find similar images and videos in a large collection
