## Tutorial

### Step 1: Integrate Mixpeek with Your Datastore

To start with automated tagging, you first need to integrate Mixpeek with your existing datastore. Follow the [integration guide](integration_guide_url) to set up the connection.

### Step 2: Configure Tagging Rules

Set up your tagging rules and preferences within the Mixpeek dashboard. Define the criteria for tag generation based on your specific requirements.

### Step 3: Implement the Tagging Pipeline

Use the Mixpeek API to create a pipeline that extracts, generates, and embeds metadata for your data. Below is an example of how to handle video data with automated tagging:

```python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek, FileTools, SourceS3

def handler(event, context):
    mixpeek = Mixpeek("API_KEY")
    file_url = SourceS3.file_url(event['bucket'], event['key'])
    video_chunks = FileTools.split_video(file_url, frame_interval=10)

    full_video = []

    for chunk in video_chunks:
        obj = {
            "tags": mixpeek.extract.video(chunk, ""),
            "description": mixpeek.generate.description(chunk, ""),
            "file_url": file_url
        }
        full_video.append(obj)

    return full_video
```

### Step 4: Enable Automated Tagging

Activate the automated tagging feature in Mixpeek. The system will start analyzing incoming data and generating tags based on the configured rules.

### Step 5: Monitor and Review Tags

Regularly monitor the generated tags through the Mixpeek dashboard. Review and adjust tagging rules as needed to ensure optimal performance and accuracy.

## Use Cases

- **Media Libraries**: Automatically tag images, videos, and audio files for easy organization and retrieval.
- **Document Management**: Enhance the searchability of text documents and PDFs by tagging key topics and concepts.
- **Content Management Systems**: Improve the categorization and management of diverse content types in your CMS.
