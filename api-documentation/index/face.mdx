The `Index Face` endpoint allows you to index faces from an image. This is useful for creating a database of faces for later recognition and search tasks.

## Request

<ParamField body="image" type="file" required>
  The image file containing faces to be indexed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="collection_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the collection to index the faces into. This must match the
  `collection_id` used with other indexes you plan on searching, as searches are
  performed within a single collection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Additional metadata to associate with the indexed faces
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message indicating the status of the face indexing process
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="face_ids" type="array">
  An array of unique identifiers for each indexed face
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "message": "Face indexing completed",
  "face_ids": ["<face_id_1>", "<face_id_2>"]
}
```

</ResponseExample>

For image files, the process is synchronous and returns the indexed face IDs immediately.
