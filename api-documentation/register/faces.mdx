description: "Register a face for future detection and search operations."
api: "POST /register/face"
---

The `Register Face` endpoint allows you to register a face image that can be later used for detection and search operations. This is particularly useful when you want to associate metadata with specific faces for identification purposes.

## Request

<ParamField body="file" type="file" required>
  The image file containing the face to register
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="collection_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the collection to associate the face with
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Additional metadata to associate with the registered face
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.mixpeek.com/register/face"

payload = {'collection_id': 'starter'}
files = [
  ('file', ('face_image.jpg', open('/path/to/face_image.jpg', 'rb'), 'image/jpeg'))
]
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer <API_KEY>'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload, files=files)

print(response.text)
```

```shell Shell
curl --location 'https://api.mixpeek.com/register/face' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
--form 'file=@"/path/to/face_image.jpg"' \
--form 'collection_id="starter"'
```

</RequestExample>

## Response

<ResponseField name="task_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for the asynchronous registration task
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "task_id": "<uuid>",
  "status": "processing"
}
```

</ResponseExample>

The response includes a `task_id` for the asynchronous face registration task. This task ID can be used to check the status of the registration process.

### Checking Task Status

To check the status of the registration task, you can use the [Task Status](/api-documentation/tasks/status) endpoint:

```
GET /tasks/<task_id>
```

Please refer to the [Task Status](/api-documentation/tasks/status) page for more details on how to check the status of your task and retrieve the results.

Once the task is completed, the result will contain the details of the registered face, including the `face_id`, `collection_id`, and any associated metadata.

Now when you use the `/understand/detect` method (within `/index`), it will automatically find the registered face and return the associated metadata.

Additionally, when doing a search the `face_id` found will be returned in the search results, allowing you to retrieve the associated metadata.
