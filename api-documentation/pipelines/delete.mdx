Pipelines are crucial in Mixpeek for processing objects in real-time. Deleting a pipeline removes it from the system and stops all associated processing.

To delete a pipeline, you'll need the `pipeline_id` of the pipeline you wish to remove.

## Request

<ParamField path="pipeline_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the pipeline to be deleted.

## Response

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean" required>
  Indicates whether the deletion was successful.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" optional>
  Provides more detail about the result of the deletion operation.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>

```python Python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek
