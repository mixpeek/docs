title: "Create Pipeline"
description: "This is where your transformations live"
api: "POST /pipelines"
---

Pipelines are the backbone of Mixpeek. It's where you describe how you want the engine to process your objects as they pass through in real-time.

To build a pipeline, you'll need to first have created a `source` and `destination` connection, then add their `connection_id` in the `connections` object.

## Request

<ParamField path="alias" type="string">
  Alias for the execution function
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code" type="string">
  The JavaScript code to execute
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="source.connection_id" type="string">
  Source connection ID
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="source.filters.foo" type="string">
  Filter key "foo" value
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="destination.connection_id" type="string">
  Destination connection ID
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="destination.collection" type="string">
  Destination collection name
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="destination.metadata.type" type="string">
  Metadata type
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transformation_code" type="string" required>
  The code, provided as a string, which dictates how the data will be
  transformed during the pipeline process.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Optional metadata to provide context or additional information about the
  pipeline being created.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="pipeline_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the newly created pipeline. This ID can be used to
  reference the pipeline in future operations.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enabled" type="boolean" optional>
  Indicates whether the pipeline is enabled upon creation. This can be set to
  true to start processing immediately.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connections" type="object" required>
  Echoes back the source and destination connection IDs provided in the request,
  confirming the data flow paths that have been set up.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="object" optional>
  Echoes back any metadata provided in the request, confirming the additional
  contextual information associated with the pipeline.
</ResponseField>
