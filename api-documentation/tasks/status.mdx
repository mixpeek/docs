description: "Retrieve the status of a specific task by its ID."
api: "GET /tasks/{task_id}"

The `Get Task Status` endpoint allows you to check the current status of a task, such as content indexing or processing. This is particularly useful for long-running operations like video processing, where you might need to poll the status periodically to determine when the task is complete.

## Request

<ParamField path="task_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the task
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="file_id" type="string">
  The ID of the file associated with the task
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="task_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier of the task
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  The current status of the task
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "file_id": "1cf48e60-05d2-4625-8f23-ae9fe6b5769b",
  "task_id": "a540420b-e1bf-4f5f-858c-1ffd7099c317",
  "status": "DONE"
}
```

## Task Status Meanings

The `status` field can have one of the following values:

| Status       | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| INITIALIZING | The task has been created and is in the initial setup phase. |
| PROCESSING   | The task is actively being worked on.                        |
| DONE         | The task has completed successfully.                         |
| FAILED       | The task encountered an error and could not be completed.    |

## Why Poll for Status?

Polling the task status is essential for operations that may take a significant amount of time to complete, such as:

1. Video processing and indexing
2. Large file uploads
3. Complex data analysis tasks
4. Batch operations on multiple items

By periodically checking the task status, you can:

- Provide progress updates to your users
- Trigger subsequent actions once a task is complete
- Handle errors or failures gracefully
- Manage resources efficiently by knowing when a task is finished

Remember to implement appropriate polling intervals and error handling in your application when using this endpoint.
