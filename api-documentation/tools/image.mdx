```python Python
from mixpeek import Mixpeek

mixpeek = Mixpeek("YOUR_API_KEY")

image_url = "https://mixpeek-public-demo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/sample-media/CR-579700.jpg"
base64_img = mixpeek.tools.image.process(image_source=image_url)

embedding = mixpeek.embed.image(
    model_id="openai-clip-vit-base-patch32",
    input=base64_img,
    input_type="base64"
)

```

<ResponseExample>
```json

    "embedding": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Response

The process method returns a list of dictionaries, each containing:

- `start_time` (float): Start time of the chunk in seconds.
- `end_time` (float): End time of the chunk in seconds.
- `base64_chunk` (str): Base64-encoded video chunk.

This tool is particularly useful when you need to embed long videos, as it allows you to process the video in smaller chunks and embed each chunk separately.
