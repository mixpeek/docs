## Setting Up an AWS S3 Connection in Mixpeek

When you establish an S3 connection in Mixpeek and attach a pipeline, Mixpeek automates several backend processes to efficiently handle and process your data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Shell
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/connections' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "alias": "my-mongo-test",
    "engine": "mongodb",
    "details": {
        "access_key": "your_access_key",
        "secret_key": "your_secret_key",
        "region": "us-east-2"
    }
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Automated Infrastructure Setup

Upon creating an S3 connection and attaching a pipeline, Mixpeek automatically sets up the following components:

1. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) Topic**: This acts as a pub/sub system. Every new object added to your S3 bucket that matches the pre-filter logic defined in your pipeline configuration triggers a notification to this SNS topic.

2. **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) Queue**: Notifications from the SNS are forwarded to this SQS queue. This decouples the process of receiving data from the processing, thereby enhancing efficiency and scalability.

3. **Serverless Functions (Create and Delete)**: These functions are triggered based on the activity in your S3 bucket:
   - **Create Function**: Activated when a new object is added to the S3 bucket. It processes the object according to the pipeline logic you define and inserts the relevant data into the designated database.
   - **Delete Function**: Handles the deletion of objects, ensuring that your database and the S3 bucket remain synchronized.

### Benefits

This setup allows Mixpeek to handle a large volume of object uploads from S3 efficiently. By processing these uploads through a scalable pipeline, it prevents overloading the inference servers and indexing pipeline, ensuring smooth and efficient data handling.
