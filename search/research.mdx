<Note>
  Research is a powerful feature that allows you to conduct multi-step explorations of your data, creating comprehensive reports through iterative searches, structured organization, and cohesive content generation.
</Note>

## What is Research?

Research in Mixpeek enables deep exploration of your content through multiple connected search operations, helping users discover insights, generate reports, and synthesize information across your multimodal data.

</Frame>

Unlike standard search which focuses on finding immediate answers, Research:
- Conducts multiple connected searches across your content
- Organizes findings into structured reports with sections
- Maintains consistent narrative and terminology across sections
- Provides citations and references to source documents
- Synthesizes information for comprehensive understanding

    # Current findings (partial results)
    if status['progress'] > 0:
        current_findings = status['current_findings']
        print(f"Sections completed: {len(current_findings['sections'])}")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // Check research status
    async function checkStatus(researchId) {
      const status = await client.research.status(researchId);
      console.log(`Research status: ${status.status}`);
      console.log(`Progress: ${status.progress}%`);
      
      // Current findings (partial results)
      if (status.progress > 0) {

        content = report["content"]
        sources = report["sources"]
        
        # Save report to file
        with open("research_report.md", "w") as f:
            f.write(content)

    curl -X GET "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/research/{research_id}" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Working with Research Reports

Research reports include both the generated content and metadata about sources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Report Structure">
    ```json
    {
      "id": "research_abc123",
      "status": "completed",
      "query": "Impact of climate change on agriculture",
      "content": "# Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture\n\n## Introduction\n...",
      "format": "markdown",
      "sources": [
        {
          "id": "doc_123",
          "title": "Climate Effects on Global Crop Yields",
          "collection": "research_papers",
          "relevance_score": 0.92,

            {
              "section": "Introduction",
              "position": "paragraph_2"
            }
          ]

          "word_count": 312,
          "sources_used": ["doc_123", "doc_456"]
        },
        // More sections...
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "completion_time": "2023-06-15T09:12:33Z",
        "total_runtime": 1632,
        "searches_performed": 28,
        "documents_analyzed": 142
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Citation Formats">
    Research reports can include citations in different formats:

    ```python
    # Request specific citation format
    report = client.research.get(
        research_id, 
        citation_format="apa"  # Options: apa, mla, chicago, ieee
    )
    ```

    The citation format affects how sources are referenced in the report content.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Craft Specific Queries">
    More specific primary queries tend to yield better-focused research reports. Consider using specific time frames, industries, or contexts in your query.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Structure for Complex Topics">
    For complex research needs, providing a custom structure helps guide the research process and ensures all critical aspects are covered.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with Taxonomies">
    Research performed on collections with well-defined [taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies) produces more coherent and structured reports.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor and Iterate">
    For large research operations, monitor progress and review early findings. You can always start a new research session with a refined query based on initial results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

- Research sessions have a maximum runtime of 1 hour (Enterprise tier)
- Maximum report size is 100,000 words
- A maximum of 500 sources can be cited in a single report
- Research depth affects both quality and processing time:
  - Quick: 1-3 minutes, surface-level exploration
  - Standard: 5-10 minutes, moderately detailed
  - Comprehensive: 15-60 minutes, highly detailed with extensive sources
