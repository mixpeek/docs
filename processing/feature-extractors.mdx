<Note>
  Feature extractors are specialized data transformation pipelines that extract meaningful information from your content. They represent the crucial "Transform" stage in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) ingestion process. Learn more about the [overall architecture](/overview/architecture) and [core concepts](/overview/concepts).
</Note>

## Overview

Feature extractors in Mixpeek are purpose-built data transformation pipelines that convert raw, unstructured content into structured, meaningful features. They operate as a distinct step in the ingestion pipeline, sitting between initial document extraction and final indexing. For more details on data management, see [buckets](/management/buckets) and [collections](/management/collections).

## The Ingestion Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extract (E)">
    Start with documents from either:
    - Unindexed documents in a [bucket](/management/buckets)
    - Documents in a [collection](/management/collections) where the index is not being used
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform (T)">
    Apply feature extractors to pull out and structure relevant data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load (L)">
    Index the extracted features for efficient search and retrieval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Creating a Collection with Feature Extractors

Here's an example of how to create a collection that uses a bucket as its source and applies multiple feature extractors. For complete Python SDK documentation, see [mixpeek on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mixpeek/).

```python
import mixpeek
from mixpeek import Mixpeek
import os

# Initialize the Mixpeek client
with Mixpeek(
    token=os.getenv("MIXPEEK_TOKEN", ""),
) as m_client:

    # Create a collection with feature extractors
    res = m_client.collections.create(
        collection_name="my-documents",
        description="A collection of processed business documents",
        source={
            "type": mixpeek.SourceType.BUCKET,
            "bucket_id": "bucket_1234567890",  # ID of the source bucket
            "prefix_key": "documents/",  # Optional prefix to filter bucket objects
            "filters": {
                "and_": [],  # List of AND conditions
                "or_": [],   # List of OR conditions
                "not_": [],  # List of NOT conditions
                "case_sensitive": True,  # Whether filters are case sensitive
            },
        },
        feature_extractors=[
            {
                "feature_extractor_name": "text-extractor",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "parameters": {
                    "min_length": 100,
                    "max_length": 1000
                },
                "input_mapping": {
                    "source_text": "content"
                },
                "output_mapping": {
                    "extracted_text": "processed_content"
                },
                "document_output_type": "TEXT",
                "document_input_handling": {
                    "type": "DIRECT",
                    "chunk_size": 1024
                },
                "document_output_handling": {
                    "type": "MERGE",
                    "strategy": "APPEND"
                }
            }
        ]
    )

    # Handle response
    print(res)
```

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a collection named "my-documents" with a description
- Using a bucket as the source of documents with:
  - Specific bucket ID
  - Optional prefix key for filtering objects
  - Configurable filters for document selection
- Applying two feature extractors with complete configurations:
  - Text extractor with:
    - Custom parameters for text length limits
    - Input/output mappings
    - Document handling configurations
  - Metadata extractor with:
    - Parameters for specific metadata fields
    - Custom input/output mappings
    - Document handling strategies

The feature extractor configuration allows you to:
- Specify custom parameters for each extractor
- Map inputs and outputs between pipeline stages
- Control how documents are handled during processing
- Define output types and handling strategies
