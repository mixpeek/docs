description: "Configurable pipelines that produce features inside documents"
---

<Note>
  Feature extractors transform raw content from buckets or collections into features stored inside documents. Availability varies by account; see the public catalog and contact support to enable additional extractors as needed.
</Note>

## Overview

- **What they do**: Run models to generate vectors and structured fields inside documents.
- **Where they run**: As part of ingestion pipelines for a target collection.
- **Outputs**: Vectors (dense, sparse, multi) and payload fields, with index definitions applied by the collection.

## Discover extractors

- Browse catalog: [mixpeek.com/extractors](https://mixpeek.com/extractors)
- Availability: Some extractors may require enablement. Contact support: [mixpeek.com/contact](https://mixpeek.com/contact)
- API:
  - [List Feature Extractors](/api-reference/feature-extractors/list-feature-extractors)
  - [Get Feature Extractor by Name](/api-reference/feature-extractors/get-feature-extractor-by-name)

## Configure in a collection

Attach extractors when creating a collection. Each entry declares the extractor name and version (plus optional parameters and mappings).

```json
{
  "collection_name": "products_v1",
  "source": {"type": "BUCKET", "bucket_id": "bkt_123"},
  "feature_extractors": [
    {
      "feature_extractor_name": "gte_modernbert_base",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "parameters": {},
      "input_mappings": {"text": "payload.title"}
    }
  ]
}
```

- Extractor outputs determine feature field names and vector index requirements for the collection.
- Use Describe Collection Features to see resolved addresses and metadata.

## Behavior & availability

- **Accountâ€‘dependent**: Certain extractors are not enabled by default; request access if needed.
- **Versioned**: Changing model versions typically requires reprocessing to keep features consistent.
- **Indexes**: Required vector/payload indexes are applied by the engine based on extractor outputs.

## Used by

- **Collections**: Store the produced features in documents ([Collections](/ingestion/collections)).
- **Retrievers**: Search across vectors and payloads ([Retrievers](/retrieval/retrievers)).
- **Taxonomies**: Join and enrich using feature fields ([Taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies)).
- **Clusters**: Build similarity groups over feature vectors ([Clusters](/enrichment/clusters)).

## Manage and inspect

- [Describe Collection Features](/api-reference/collections/describe-collection-features) to see addresses and indexes.
- [List Feature Extractors](/api-reference/feature-extractors/list-feature-extractors) to view available extractors.
