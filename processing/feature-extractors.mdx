<Note>
  Feature extractors are specialized data transformation pipelines that extract meaningful information from your content. They represent the crucial "Transform" stage in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) ingestion process. Learn more about the [overall architecture](/overview/architecture) and [core concepts](/overview/concepts).
</Note>

## Overview

Feature extractors in Mixpeek are purpose-built data transformation pipelines that convert raw, unstructured content into structured, meaningful features. They operate as a distinct step in the ingestion pipeline, sitting between initial document extraction and final indexing. For more details on data management, see [buckets](/management/buckets) and [collections](/management/collections).

## The Ingestion Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extract (E)">
    Start with documents from either:
    - Unindexed documents in a [bucket](/management/buckets)
    - Documents in a [collection](/management/collections) where the index is not being used
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform (T)">
    Apply feature extractors to pull out and structure relevant data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load (L)">
    Index the extracted features for efficient search and retrieval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Document Processing Pipeline

Here's an example of how feature extractors fit into a complete document processing pipeline:

```python
from mixpeek import Pipeline

# Configure the pipeline stages
pipeline = Pipeline(
    extractors=[
        # Document extraction stage
        DocumentExtractor(),
        
        # Feature extraction stage
        TextFeatureExtractor(),
        MetadataExtractor(),
        CustomDomainExtractor(),
        
        # Indexing stage
        FeatureIndexer()
    ]
)

# Process documents through the pipeline
results = pipeline.process(documents)
```

For more examples and implementation details, see the [Studio Walkthrough](/studio) and [API Reference](/api-reference).

## Limitations

- Maximum document size: 100MB per file
- Processing timeout: 5 minutes per document
- Concurrent extractions: 20 per account
- Supported file types vary by extractor type
- Custom extractors require Enterprise plan

For complete details on system limits, see [Limits](/troubleshooting/limits).
