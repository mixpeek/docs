title: "Tasks"
description: "Monitor and manage asynchronous processing jobs"
---

<Note>
  Tasks represent asynchronous jobs in Mixpeek (e.g., batch submissions, extraction runs). Use tasks to track status, progress, and results without blocking requests.
</Note>

## Overview

- **What they are**: Records of long-running operations (ingestion, enrichment, clustering, etc.).
- **When created**: Automatically when you submit batches or trigger other long-running operations.
- **How used**: Poll or list tasks to monitor execution; optionally cancel when supported.

## Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Created">
    The task is created by the API when you start an async operation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Queued">
    Waiting for a worker to pick up
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    Actively running
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed/Failed/Canceled">
    Finishes successfully, errors, or is canceled
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Statuses (API enum)

- **DRAFT**: Initial state for draft tasks (e.g., batch created but not submitted)
- **PENDING**: Accepted and waiting to be picked up (queued)
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Transitioning to active execution
- **PROCESSING**: Actively executing the task
- **COMPLETED**: Finished successfully; results available
- **FAILED**: Error occurred during execution
- **CANCELED**: Stopped before completion by user/system
- **SKIPPED**: Intentionally not executed as part of a larger workflow
- **UNKNOWN**: State could not be determined

<Note>
  UI/logs may show conceptual states like Created/Queued/Processing. These map roughly to DRAFT/PENDING/PROCESSING in the API enum.
</Note>

## How tasks are created

- Submitting a batch for processing creates a task
- Other long-running routes may also create tasks depending on the operation

## Manage tasks

- [Get Task Information](/api-reference/tasks/get-task-information)
- [List Active Tasks](/api-reference/tasks/list-active-tasks)
- [Kill Task](/api-reference/tasks/kill-task)

## Best practices

- **Store task IDs**: Keep the returned `task_id` for later checks
- **Timeouts**: Use timeouts/backoff when polling
- **Error handling**: Handle `FAILED` and `CANCELED` states explicitly
- **Webhooks**: Prefer webhooks for notifications over tight polling
