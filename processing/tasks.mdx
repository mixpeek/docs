<Note>
  Tasks represent processing jobs in Mixpeek. They allow you to track the status, progress, and results of pipeline executions and other asynchronous operations.
</Note>

## Overview

In Mixpeek, tasks represent processing jobs that are executed asynchronously. When you trigger a pipeline to process an object or run any other long-running operation, a task is created to track its execution status, progress, and results.

    Tasks allow you to submit processing jobs and check their status later, without having to wait for completion
  </Card>

## Task Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">
    A task is created when you trigger a processing operation, such as running a pipeline on an object
  </Step>
  <Step title="Queuing">
    The task enters a queue and waits to be picked up by a worker
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    The task begins execution, processing the requested operation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completion">
    The task finishes successfully, producing the desired results
  </Step>
</Steps>

During this lifecycle, a task can also encounter errors or be cancelled:

## Task Statuses

| Status | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| created | üü¢ | The task has been created but not yet queued for processing. |
| queued | ‚è±Ô∏è | The task is in the processing queue, waiting to be picked up by a worker. |
| processing | ‚öôÔ∏è | The task is currently being executed. |
| completed | ‚úÖ | The task has been successfully completed, and the results are available. |
| failed | ‚ùå | The task encountered an error during execution and could not be completed. |
| cancelled | üö´ | The task was manually cancelled before completion. |

## Creating Tasks

Tasks are typically created indirectly by triggering other operations. The most common way to create a task is by creating an object in your bucket. If there are collections that use it as a source, tasks will be created. 


## Common Task Types

  <Card title="object_create" icon="conveyor-belt">
    Processing an object with a collection
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="model_tuning" icon="sliders">
    Tuning a machine learning model with custom data
  </Card>

  <Card title="batch_import" icon="file-import">
    Importing multiple objects in a batch
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="taxonomy_apply" icon="sitemap">
    Applying a taxonomy to a collection
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="clustering" icon="object-group">
    Running clustering algorithms on a collection
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="index_rebuild" icon="database">
    Rebuilding feature store indexes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Task IDs" icon="id-badge">
    Always store task IDs when triggering operations to allow status checking later
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Implement Timeouts" icon="stopwatch">
    Add reasonable timeouts when waiting for tasks to complete to avoid blocking indefinitely
  </Card>

  <Card title="Handle Failures" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Implement proper error handling to address failed tasks and understand the cause
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Webhooks" icon="bell">
    Set up webhooks for task notifications rather than continuous polling for better performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Limitations

- **Processing Timeout:** Tasks time out after 30 minutes of processing
- **Log Retention:** Task logs are retained for 7 days
- **Record Retention:** Completed task records are retained for 30 days
- **Concurrency Limits:** Maximum of 100 concurrent tasks per namespace
