<Note>
  Retrievers are the core search components of Mixpeek, providing flexible and powerful ways to search across your multimodal content with customizable pipelines.
</Note>

## Overview

Retrievers in Mixpeek are configurable search pipelines that allow you to search across your processed content using a combination of vector similarity, metadata filtering, and other search techniques. 

They provide a flexible way to build sophisticated search experiences tailored to your specific use cases.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Retriever Query Schema">
    Specify the structure of queries that your retriever will accept, including required and optional parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Stages">
    Choose which retrieval stages to include in your pipeline, such as vector search, filtering, reranking, or fusion stages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Inputs and Outputs">
    For each stage, define how it receives inputs from previous stages and how its outputs will be passed to subsequent stages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Retriever">
    Save your configured retriever to make it available for queries within your namespace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Query">
    Run search operations using your retriever with queries that match the defined schema structure.
  </Step>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>  
  <Accordion title="Schema Validation" icon="brackets-curly">
    When creating your retriever, you specify the schema that all queries must adhere to. This is strictly enforced.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pipeline Stages" icon="layer-group">
    Retrievers are composed of stages that define how the search is performed. Each stage performs a specific search operation and passes its results to the next stage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stage Types" icon="boxes-stacked">
    Different stage types support different search capabilities, such as vector search, filtering, ranking, and rewriting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Input/Output Flow" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Each stage can take input from previous stages and provide output to subsequent stages, creating a flexible data flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Query Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Retrievers accept query parameters that control how the search is performed, such as text queries, vector embeddings, and filter conditions.

## Creating a Basic Retriever

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create a basic retriever with a single vector search stage
  retriever = mp.retrievers.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="simple-search",
      description="Basic text search across documents",
      stages=[
          {
              "name": "vector_search",
              "type": "vector",
              "collection_id": "col_def456",
              "index": "text",
              "limit": 20
          }
      ]
  )
  
  retriever_id = retriever["retriever_id"]
  print(f"Created retriever: {retriever_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create a basic retriever with a single vector search stage
  const retriever = await mp.retrievers.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "simple-search",
    description: "Basic text search across documents",
    stages: [
      {
        name: "vector_search",
        type: "vector",
        collection_id: "col_def456",
        index: "text",
        limit: 20
      }
    ]
  });
  
  const retrieverId = retriever.retriever_id;
  console.log(`Created retriever: ${retrieverId}`);
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/retrievers" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "namespace_id": "ns_abc123",
      "name": "simple-search",
      "description": "Basic text search across documents",
      "stages": [
        {

          "collection_id": "col_def456",
          "index": "text",
          "limit": 20
        }
      ]
    }'

Once you've created a retriever, you can use it to search your content:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Search using a text query
  results = mp.retrievers.execute(
      retriever_id=retriever_id,
      query={
          "text": "machine learning algorithms for image classification"
      }
  )
  
  # Display results
  for result in results["results"]:
      print(f"Document: {result['document_id']}")
      print(f"Score: {result['score']}")
      print(f"Content: {result.get('title', 'N/A')}")
      print("---")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Search using a text query
  const results = await mp.retrievers.search({
    retriever_id: retrieverId,
    query: {
      text: "machine learning algorithms for image classification"
    }
  });
  
  // Display results
  for (const result of results.results) {
    console.log(`Document: ${result.document_id}`);
    console.log(`Score: ${result.score}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${result.title || 'N/A'}`);
    console.log("---");
  }
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST "https://api.mixpeek.com/v1/retrievers/RETRIEVER_ID/search" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": {
        "text": "machine learning algorithms for image classification"
      }
    }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Query Parameters

Different retriever stages can utilize different query parameters:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Text Queries" icon="font">
    ```json
    {
      "text": "machine learning algorithms"
    }
    ```
    
    Text queries are automatically converted to embeddings for vector search.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Image Queries" icon="image">
    ```json
    {
      "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    }
    ```
    
    Image URLs are processed to extract visual embeddings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hybrid Queries" icon="object-group">
    ```json
    {
      "text": "red dress with floral pattern",
      "image_url": "https://example.com/dress-example.jpg"
    }
    ```
    
    Combining text and image for multimodal search.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vector Queries" icon="network-wired">
    ```json
    {
      "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],
      "index": "text"
    }
    ```
    
    Directly provide vector embeddings for search.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Retriever Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Semantic Search">
    ### Content-Based Semantic Search

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    Begin with a simple retriever design and add complexity as needed. Often a basic vector search with filtering is sufficient.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Appropriate Indexes">
    Choose the right vector indexes for your content type. Use "text" for text-heavy content, "multimodal" for mixed content, and "image" for visual search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pre-filter When Possible">
    Apply metadata filters early in the pipeline to reduce the number of documents that need vector similarity calculation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mind Your Limits">
    Set appropriate limits at each stage. Start with larger limits in early stages and narrow down in later stages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage Caching">
    Use caching to improve performance for frequently accessed queries. See the [Caching documentation](/overview/caching) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Complex retrievers with many stages can impact search latency. Start with a simple design and add complexity only when needed for your use case.
