<Note>
  Research is a powerful feature that allows you to conduct multi-step explorations of your data, creating comprehensive reports through iterative searches, structured organization, and cohesive content generation.
</Note>

## Overview

Research in Mixpeek enables deep exploration of your content through multiple connected search operations, helping users discover insights, generate reports, and synthesize information across your multimodal data.

Unlike standard search which focuses on finding immediate answers, Research:
- Conducts multiple connected searches across your content
- Organizes findings into structured reports with sections
- Maintains consistent narrative and terminology across sections
- Provides citations and references to source documents
- Synthesizes information for comprehensive understanding

    # Get final research report
    report = client.research.get(research_id)
    
    if report["status"] == "completed":
        # Access the full report
        content = report["content"]
        sources = report["sources"]
        
        # Save report to file
        with open("research_report.md", "w") as f:
            f.write(content)
            
        print(f"Report generated with {len(sources)} source citations")

      if (report.status === "completed") {
        // Access the full report
        const content = report.content;
        const sources = report.sources;
        
        // Do something with the report

## Working with Research Reports

Research reports include both the generated content and metadata about sources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Report Structure">
    ```json
    {
      "id": "research_abc123",
      "status": "completed",
      "query": "Impact of climate change on agriculture",
      "content": "# Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture\n\n## Introduction\n...",
      "format": "markdown",
      "sources": [
        {
          "id": "doc_123",
          "title": "Climate Effects on Global Crop Yields",
          "collection": "research_papers",
          "relevance_score": 0.92,
          "citations": [
            {
              "section": "Introduction",
              "position": "paragraph_2"
            }
          ]
        },
        // More sources...
      ],
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Introduction",
          "word_count": 312,
          "sources_used": ["doc_123", "doc_456"]
        },
        // More sections...
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "completion_time": "2023-06-15T09:12:33Z",
        "total_runtime": 1632,
        "searches_performed": 28,
        "documents_analyzed": 142
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Citation Formats">
    Research reports can include citations in different formats:

    ```python
    # Request specific citation format
    report = client.research.get(
        research_id, 
        citation_format="apa"  # Options: apa, mla, chicago, ieee
    )
    ```

    The citation format affects how sources are referenced in the report content.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Craft Specific Queries">
    More specific primary queries tend to yield better-focused research reports. Consider using specific time frames, industries, or contexts in your query.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Structure for Complex Topics">
    For complex research needs, providing a custom structure helps guide the research process and ensures all critical aspects are covered.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Combine with Taxonomies">
    Research performed on collections with well-defined [taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies) produces more coherent and structured reports.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor and Iterate">
    For large research operations, monitor progress and review early findings. You can always start a new research session with a refined query based on initial results.
  </Accordion>

## Limitations

- **Session Duration:** Research sessions have a maximum runtime of 1 hour (Enterprise tier)
- **Report Size:** Maximum report size is 100,000 words
- **Source Constraints:** A maximum of 500 sources can be cited in a single report
- **Processing Tiers:** Research depth affects both quality and processing time:
  - **Quick Mode:** 1-3 minutes, surface-level exploration
  - **Standard Mode:** 5-10 minutes, moderately detailed
  - **Comprehensive Mode:** 15-60 minutes, highly detailed with extensive sources
