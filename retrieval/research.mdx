<Note>
  Research chains multiple retrieval steps to explore a topic, organize findings, and synthesize a cohesive report. It builds on retrievers, pipelines, and interactions rather than a single API call.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi‑step Search" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Break complex questions into sequential, targeted retrieval steps
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Structured Synthesis" icon="file-lines">
    Organize findings into sections and produce a coherent narrative
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Source‑grounded" icon="quote-left">
    Maintain citations and lineage back to original documents
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Configurable Flow" icon="diagram-project">
    Compose with retrievers, pipelines, and enrichment stages

## How it works

<Frame>
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    Q[Primary Question] --> T[Topic Breakdown]
    T --> S[Sequential Searches]
    S --> O[Organize Findings]
    O --> R[Report Assembly]
  ```
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Decompose">
    Split the question into sub‑topics and define per‑topic retrieval intents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve">
    Execute retrievers per sub‑topic; apply filters, grouping, and selection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enrich">
    Optionally apply taxonomies or clustering to label and group
  </Step>
  <Step title="Synthesize">
    Assemble a structured report with sections and citations
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Literature Review">
    - Query recent papers, group by venue or year
    - Extract abstracts, key findings, and limitations
    - Summarize trends with citations back to source docs
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Competitive Analysis">
    - Retrieve product specs, pricing, and announcements across sources
    - Group by competitor and category; highlight deltas
    - Produce an executive summary with referenced evidence
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Incident Investigation">
    - Pull logs, tickets, runbooks, and chat transcripts
    - Timeline events and root‑cause factors
    - Generate an RCA draft linking to underlying artifacts
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define scope">
    Set clear sub‑topics and stop criteria to bound exploration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Curate signals">
    Prefer high‑precision filters and groupings for each step
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cite sources">
    Preserve document ids and metadata to ground conclusions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">
    Refine prompts, filters, and stage parameters based on gaps
  </Step>
</Steps>
