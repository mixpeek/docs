```python
import base64
import mixpeek

byte_data = b'binary data here'
encoded_data = base64.b64encode(byte_data)

# insert file (this should also kick off multimodal pipeline)
response = await mixpeek.db.insert_one(
    base64_data=encoded_data,
    filename="blah.jpg",
    data={
        "foo": "bar"
    }
)

{
    "url": "s3://bucket/path/to/file",
    "foo": "bar",
    "_id": "5f3e4b3b7b3b4b3b4b3b4b3b"
}

```

### How does it work?

You encode your file into base64, then use `mixpeek.db` to insert the file and metadata into your storage of choice.

This also will chunk up the file on the client side into 5 mb chunks, iterate through each
