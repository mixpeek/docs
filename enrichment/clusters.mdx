<Note>
  Clustering in Mixpeek serves as the multimodal equivalent of SQL GROUP BY operations, allowing you to group similar documents together based on feature similarity rather than exact field matches.
</Note>

## Overview

Clustering enables you to organize and group documents based on their feature similarity. Unlike traditional SQL GROUP BY operations that group rows based on exact field matches, clustering uses similarity metrics to group documents that share similar characteristics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Clustering Approach">
    Choose between two clustering methods:
    
    **Vector-Based Clustering**
    Groups documents based on semantic similarity using embedding vectors and clustering algorithms like HDBSCAN or K-Means.
    
    **Attribute-Based Grouping**
    Groups documents based on specific metadata attributes like categories, dates, or custom fields.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Set specific parameters for your chosen approach. For vector-based clustering, select the embedding model and algorithm (e.g., HDBSCAN). For attribute-based, select the fields to group by.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Cluster Naming">
    Set up automatic cluster naming:
    
    **Automatic Naming**
    - Enable: Yes/No
    - Generative Model: GPT-4o
    - Method: Centroid
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Target Collection">
    Choose which collection the cluster information will be added to. This determines which documents will be grouped together.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Execution Schedule">
    Determine when clustering will run:
    - One-time execution
    - Scheduled at a defined cadence (daily, weekly, etc.)
    - Trigger-based (when new documents are added)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Details

### Dimensional Reduction and Visualization

Before applying clustering algorithms, high-dimensional feature vectors (like embeddings) are reduced to lower dimensions using techniques like UMAP or t-SNE. This process serves two important purposes:

1. **Improves Clustering Performance**: Reduces computational complexity and often leads to better cluster separation
2. **Enables Visual Inspection**: Allows you to visualize feature relationships in 2D or 3D space

</Frame>

This visualization step is crucial for:
- Validating clustering quality before applying
- Identifying outliers or unexpected groupings
- Determining optimal cluster parameters
- Communicating patterns to stakeholders

### Clustering Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature Selection">
    Choose which features to use for clustering (e.g., embeddings, timestamps, categories)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dimensional Reduction">
    Apply UMAP or t-SNE to reduce high-dimensional features to 2D or 3D for visualization and improved clustering
  </Step>
  <Step title="Algorithm Configuration">
    Configure clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters, similarity thresholds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grouping Execution">
    Apply the clustering algorithm to group similar documents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result Storage">
    Store cluster assignments and metadata for future retrieval
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Feature Selection" icon="check">
    Choose features that best represent the similarity you want to capture. For example:
    - Use embeddings for semantic similarity
    - Use timestamps for temporal grouping
    - Use categorical features for topic-based grouping
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Algorithm Choice" icon="microchip">
    Select clustering algorithms based on your needs:
    - K-means for well-defined, spherical clusters
    - DBSCAN for density-based clustering
    - Custom algorithms for specialized grouping criteria
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Considerations" icon="gauge-high">
    Consider the computational complexity of your chosen algorithm and the size of your document collection when planning clustering operations.

## Limitations

- **Document Threshold:** Maximum of 100,000 documents per clustering operation
- **Algorithm Constraints:** K-means limited to 1,000 clusters; HDBSCAN limited to 50,000 documents
- **Visualization Limits:** t-SNE and UMAP visualizations limited to 10,000 points for performance reasons
- **Reclustering Frequency:** Scheduled clustering limited to once per hour at minimum intervals
- **Feature Compatibility:** Not all feature types can be used for clustering (e.g., some binary features)
- **Processing Time:** Large-scale clustering operations may take several minutes to complete
- **Cluster Storage:** Cluster assignments persist for 90 days by default before requiring refresh
- **Naming Generation:** Automatic cluster naming limited to 50 characters per cluster label
