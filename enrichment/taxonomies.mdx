<Note>
  Taxonomies in Mixpeek allow you to classify, organize, and enrich your content with structured metadata, functioning as the multimodal analogue to SQL JOIN operations.
</Note>

## Overview

Taxonomies in Mixpeek are specialized structures that allow you to classify, organize, and enrich your data with structured metadata. They function similarly to JOIN operations in traditional databases, but operate on feature similarity rather than exact key matches, making them ideal for multimodal content. Conceptually, each taxonomy functions as a specialized collection with a defined schema. Associated retrievers handle the logic for looking up and enriching documents based on this taxonomy.

## Types of Taxonomies

Mixpeek supports two main types of taxonomies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flat Taxonomies" icon="grip-lines">
    Flat taxonomies are simple, single-level classification systems that enrich documents with metadata from a reference collection.
    
    **Key characteristics:**
    - Function as a join operation between collections
    - Add metadata or tags from one collection to another
    - No hierarchical relationships between categories
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Simple categorization (product types, content formats)
    - Attribute tagging (colors, sizes, features)
    - Binary classification (safe/unsafe, approved/unapproved)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Taxonomies" icon="network-wired">
    Hierarchical taxonomies organize categories in parent-child relationships **within a single taxonomy**, allowing for more complex classification systems. This is often referred to as **intra-taxonomy hierarchy**.
    
    **Key characteristics:**
    - Multi-level organization with parent-child relationships
    - Property inheritance from parent to child nodes
    - Support for complex nested categorization
    
    Hierarchies can be implemented in two ways:
    
    1. **Explicit Hierarchy**
       - Parent-child relationships defined directly in configuration
       - Clear, intentional structure specification
       - Recommended for complex hierarchies with well-defined levels

    2. **Implicit Hierarchy**
       - Relationships are inferred dynamically based on data behavior, shared identifiers, feature similarity (like embeddings), or through the chaining of retrievers across different collections. 
       - This is more flexible but requires careful design of features and retriever logic.
       - It enables powerful **inter-taxonomy relationships** (e.g., linking Faces to Scenes), effectively creating joins across different types of data.
    
    **Use cases:**
    - *Intra-Taxonomy:* Product categories (Electronics > Computers > Laptops), Content taxonomies (Science > Physics > Quantum Mechanics)
    - *Inter-Taxonomy (Implicit):* Linking faces identified in images to scenes where they appear, connecting product mentions in text to product catalog entries.

## Creating a Taxonomy

### Flat Taxonomy

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create a flat taxonomy
  taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="product_categories",
      description="Product category classification",
      taxonomy_type="flat",
      retriever={
          "retriever_id": "ret_def456",  # Existing retriever for matching
          "threshold": 0.7               # Similarity threshold
      },
      source_collections=[
          {
              "collection_id": "col_categories",
              "enrichment_fields": ["category", "department", "tax_rate"]
          }
      ]
  )
  
  taxonomy_id = taxonomy["taxonomy_id"]
  print(f"Created taxonomy: {taxonomy_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create a flat taxonomy
  const taxonomy = await mp.taxonomies.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "product_categories",
    description: "Product category classification",
    taxonomy_type: "flat",
    retriever: {
      retriever_id: "ret_def456",  // Existing retriever for matching
      threshold: 0.7               // Similarity threshold
    },
    source_collections: [
      {
        collection_id: "col_categories",
        enrichment_fields: ["category", "department", "tax_rate"]
      }
    ]
  });
  
  const taxonomyId = taxonomy.taxonomy_id;
  console.log(`Created taxonomy: ${taxonomyId}`);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Hierarchical Taxonomy

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Create a hierarchical taxonomy
  taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="organization_structure",
      description="Company organizational structure",
      taxonomy_type="hierarchical",
      retriever={
          "retriever_id": "ret_ghi789"
      },
      hierarchical_config={
          "collection_nodes": [
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_people",
                  "parent_collection_id": None,  # Top-level collection
                  "enrichment_fields": ["name", "basic_access"]
              },
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_employees",
                  "parent_collection_id": "col_people",  # Child of people
                  "enrichment_fields": ["employee_id", "department"]
              },
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_executives",
                  "parent_collection_id": "col_employees",  # Child of employees
                  "enrichment_fields": ["executive_level", "budget_authority"]
              }
          ]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Create a hierarchical taxonomy
  const taxonomy = await mp.taxonomies.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "organization_structure",
    description: "Company organizational structure",
    taxonomy_type: "hierarchical",
    retriever: {
      retriever_id: "ret_ghi789"
    },
    hierarchical_config: {
      collection_nodes: [
        {
          collection_id: "col_people",
          parent_collection_id: null,  // Top-level collection
          enrichment_fields: ["name", "basic_access"]
        },
        {
          collection_id: "col_employees",
          parent_collection_id: "col_people",  // Child of people
          enrichment_fields: ["employee_id", "department"]
        },
        {
          collection_id: "col_executives",
          parent_collection_id: "col_employees",  // Child of employees
          enrichment_fields: ["executive_level", "budget_authority"]
        }
      ]
    }
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Applying Taxonomies

Once you've created a taxonomy, you can apply it to enrich documents in your collections.

## Materialization Options

When applying taxonomies, you have two main materialization options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Materialized" icon="database">
    Creates enriched documents in a specified output collection
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Faster query performance
    - Pre-computed enrichments
    - Historical enrichment tracking
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Requires additional storage
    - Needs re-application when taxonomy changes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="On-Demand" icon="bolt">
    Computes enrichments during query execution
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Always uses latest taxonomy
    - No duplicate storage required
    - Automatic updates with taxonomy changes
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Higher query-time compute costs
    - Potentially slower query performance
    - Cannot track historical enrichment changes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Taxonomy Node Structure

In a hierarchical taxonomy, nodes are documents in collections with specific structures:

```json
// Example: Executive node in a hierarchical taxonomy
{
  "document_id": "doc_abc123",
  "collection_id": "col_executives",
  // Person properties (inherited from col_people)
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "basic_access": true,
  
  // Employee properties (inherited from col_employees)
  "employee_id": "E12345",
  "department": "Marketing",
  
  // Executive-specific properties
  "executive_level": "VP",
  "budget_authority": 5000000,
  
  // Embedding for matching
  "face_embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
}
```

### Property Inheritance

In hierarchical taxonomies, properties are inherited from parent to child nodes:

- Child nodes inherit all properties from their parent nodes
- Child nodes can override inherited properties with their own values
- Inheritance follows the collection hierarchy defined in the taxonomy
- While explicit hierarchies use defined parent-child links for inheritance, implicit relationships facilitate a similar flow of enrichment data between linked documents identified during the retrieval process (e.g., a Scene document inheriting details from a matched Face document).

### Enrichment and Retrieval Processes

The way taxonomies populate data (**Enrichment**) and how that populated data is subsequently used for filtering and searching (**Retrieval**) differs significantly based on whether the relationships are explicit (intra-taxonomy trees) or implicit (inter-taxonomy links or dynamic connections).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Explicit Hierarchy Enrichment & Retrieval">
    Based on structured, declared relationships (like a tree).
    
    - **Enrichment Process:**
      - Happens via rule-based assignment or direct classification within the taxonomy structure.
      - Documents can be automatically enriched with properties from all ancestor nodes by traversing the defined hierarchy (e.g., `parent` links).
      - Often uses explicit fields like `parent`, `depth`, or `path` calculated during ingestion.
      
      **Example:** A document classified under `Photography` is automatically enriched with `Visual` and `Media` tags if those are its defined ancestors.
    
    - **Retrieval Process (Querying with Hierarchy):**
      - Once documents are enriched with their hierarchical tags (as described above), you can leverage this structure during searches and filtering.
      - Supports deterministic broad-to-narrow filtering: Querying for a parent term (e.g., `Visual`) retrieves items tagged with its descendants (e.g., `Photography`, `Illustration`).
      - This filtering relies on the pre-established hierarchical metadata associated with the documents.
      - Filter expansion is predictable based on the tree structure (e.g., `WHERE category IN subtree('Visual')`).
      - Ideal for UI tree filters and structured browsing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implicit Relationship Enrichment & Retrieval">
    Based on dynamically inferred relationships (shared keys, embeddings, retriever chains).
    
    - **Enrichment Process:**
      - Often happens dynamically during ingestion or retrieval via feature extractors or retriever chaining.
      - Enrichment flows based on identified connections rather than a static tree (e.g., a Scene document gets enriched with data from a matched Face document via a shared `face_id` or embedding similarity).
      - Inputs for enrichment are resolved from related data points (e.g., `face_id` from a face detector feeds into a scene taxonomy retriever).

      **Example:** A feature extraction pipeline identifies a face (`face_id: 123`), and a subsequent step uses this ID to query a Scene taxonomy, enriching the original document with relevant scene information associated with `face_id: 123`.
    
    - **Retrieval Process:**
      - Works as multi-step retrieval chains or composite queries (graph traversal).
      - Enables multi-hop search patterns (e.g., Find Face -> Use Face ID to find Scenes -> Use Scene Info to find Episodes).
      - Often handled by query pipelines that dynamically chain retrieval stages based on intermediate results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Comparison Table

| Feature             | Explicit Hierarchy (Intra-Taxonomy) | Implicit Relationships (Inter-Taxonomy / Dynamic) |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Defined by**      | Schema (`parent`, structure)       | Data behavior, shared IDs, retriever chaining  |
| **Enrichment**      | Rule-based, tree traversal         | Dynamic, input-driven enrichment chains         |
| **Retrieval**       | `IN subtree("X")`, static filters  | Chained stages (e.g., Face → Scene → Cluster)     |
| **Query Composition** | Single query, expanded filters    | Multi-step query pipeline, composite queries    |
| **Analogy**         | Folder structure / Tree            | SQL JOINs / Graph Traversal                     |
| **Examples**        | Category trees, org charts         | Face → Scene → Episode links, Product Mentions  |

## Using Enriched Documents

Once you've applied a taxonomy, you can use the enriched fields in searches and filters:

```python
# Search using enriched taxonomy fields
results = mp.retrievers.execute(
    retriever_id="ret_jkl012",
    query={
        "text": "marketing presentation"
    },
    filters={
        "department": "Marketing",  # Taxonomy-enriched field
        "executive_level": {"$exists": True}  # Only match executive content
    }
)
```

## Example Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Product Categorization">
    Create a product taxonomy to automatically classify products and inherit category properties:
    
    ```python
    # Create product category taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="product_hierarchy",
        description="Product category hierarchy",
        taxonomy_type="hierarchical",
        retriever={
            "retriever_id": "ret_product_matcher"
        },
        hierarchical_config={
            "collection_nodes": [
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_categories",
                    "parent_collection_id": None,
                    "enrichment_fields": ["category", "tax_group"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_subcategories",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_categories",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["subcategory", "warranty_policy"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_product_types",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_subcategories",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["product_type", "return_window"]
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
    
    This creates a three-level product hierarchy where each level inherits properties from its parent.

  <Tab title="Content Tagging">
    Create a flat taxonomy for automatically tagging content with relevant topics:
    
    ```python
    # Create content tagging taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="content_topics",
        description="Content topic classification",
        taxonomy_type="flat",
        retriever={
            "retriever_id": "ret_topic_matcher",

                "enrichment_fields": ["topic", "subtopics", "audience_level"]
            }
        ]
    )
    ```
    
    Apply this taxonomy to automatically tag articles, blog posts, or other content with relevant topics.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Face Recognition">
    Create a hierarchical taxonomy for recognizing faces and applying appropriate metadata:
    
    ```python
    # Create face recognition taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="personnel_faces",

                }
            ]
        }
    )

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Thoughtful Hierarchies">
    For hierarchical taxonomies, carefully plan the levels and inheritance relationships to avoid redundancy and maximize usability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Retriever Performance">
    Create efficient retrievers for taxonomy matching, focusing on the most distinctive features for each node type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider Materialization Strategy">
    Choose between materialized and on-demand enrichment based on your query patterns, update frequency, and storage constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Representative Data">
    Validate taxonomy performance with representative test data before applying to your full collection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Taxonomies with many nodes or complex hierarchies can impact application performance. Optimize your taxonomy structure and retriever configuration for the best balance of accuracy and performance.

## API Reference

For complete details on working with taxonomies, see our [Taxonomies API Reference](/api-reference/taxonomies/create-taxonomy).

### 🧩 Where Do Retriever Inputs Get Their Values?

There are two key sources for these inputs, depending on **when** the retriever is being executed:

---

### 1. **During Ingestion (a.k.a. feature extraction time)**

Here, values for retriever inputs come from:

- **Raw uploaded data** (e.g., file contents, video frames, text)
- **Output of previous extractors** (e.g., OCR → text → entity recognition)
- **Static metadata** from the doc (e.g., file name, timestamp)

You often see this in the config like:

```yaml
feature_extractors:
  - type: taxonomy_extraction
    taxonomy: "scene_taxonomy"
```

In this case, a retriever associated with the taxonomy might pull its input from:

```json
{
  "text": "<output of OCR>",
  "image": "<scene frame>",
  ...
}
```

---

### 2. **During Query / Retrieval Time**

When someone is **searching**, retriever inputs can come from:

- **User query inputs** (text, filters, embeddings)
- **Intermediate outputs** in the retrieval pipeline (e.g., a `face_id` found from a face query used as input into a `scene_taxonomy` retriever)
- **Query pipelines** can be pre-defined to wire these together dynamically, as in:

```json
{
  "face_input": "img_of_brad_pitt.jpg",
  "scene_query": "fighting scene"
}
```

Then one retriever resolves the face to a canonical ID, which is used as a pre-filter in another retriever's execution.

---

### 🔄 Enrichment on Retrieval

When we say "fields get enriched on retrieval execution," it means:

- A taxonomy's retriever will take the inputs and try to compute or resolve field values (like resolving `"John Wick"` → `character_id`)
- This can happen "on demand" for a query result if the field wasn't stored pre-computed

So the same retriever logic might be used both:

- **During ingestion** (to store the enriched field)
- **During query** (to enrich or filter results live)

---

### 🧠 Bonus Analogy

Think of a taxonomy collection as a **smart join table**:

- Each row is an entity
- The retrievers act like **lookup functions** that populate columns
- The inputs to those functions come either from **raw docs**, **previous retrievers**, or **user queries**
