<Note>
  Taxonomies in Mixpeek allow you to classify, organize, and enrich your content with structured metadata, functioning as the multimodal analogue to SQL JOIN operations.
</Note>

## Overview

Taxonomies in Mixpeek are specialized structures that allow you to classify, organize, and enrich your data with structured metadata. They function similarly to JOIN operations in traditional databases, but operate on feature similarity rather than exact key matches, making them ideal for multimodal content.

## Types of Taxonomies

Mixpeek supports two main types of taxonomies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flat Taxonomies" icon="grip-lines">
    Flat taxonomies are simple, single-level classification systems that enrich documents with metadata from a reference collection.
    
    **Key characteristics:**
    - Function as a join operation between collections
    - Add metadata or tags from one collection to another
    - No hierarchical relationships between categories
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Simple categorization (product types, content formats)
    - Attribute tagging (colors, sizes, features)
    - Binary classification (safe/unsafe, approved/unapproved)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Taxonomies" icon="network-wired">
    Hierarchical taxonomies organize categories in parent-child relationships, allowing for more complex classification systems.
    
    **Key characteristics:**
    - Multi-level organization with parent-child relationships
    - Property inheritance from parent to child nodes
    - Support for complex nested categorization
    
    Hierarchies can be implemented in two ways:
    
    1. **Explicit Hierarchy**
       - Parent-child relationships defined directly in configuration
       - Clear, intentional structure specification
       - Recommended for complex hierarchies

    2. **Implicit Hierarchy**
       - Relationships inferred from metadata field patterns
       - More flexible but requires careful metadata management
       - Suitable for simpler, metadata-driven hierarchies
    
    **Use cases:**
    - Product categories (Electronics > Computers > Laptops)
    - Content taxonomies (Science > Physics > Quantum Mechanics)
    - Organizational structures (Company > Department > Team)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating a Taxonomy

### Flat Taxonomy

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from mixpeek import Mixpeek
  
  mp = Mixpeek(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
  
  # Create a flat taxonomy
  taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="product_categories",
      description="Product category classification",
      taxonomy_type="flat",
      retriever={
          "retriever_id": "ret_def456",  # Existing retriever for matching
          "threshold": 0.7               # Similarity threshold
      },
      source_collections=[
          {
              "collection_id": "col_categories",
              "enrichment_fields": ["category", "department", "tax_rate"]
          }
      ]
  )
  
  taxonomy_id = taxonomy["taxonomy_id"]
  print(f"Created taxonomy: {taxonomy_id}")
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  import { Mixpeek } from '@mixpeek/sdk';
  
  const mp = new Mixpeek({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  
  // Create a flat taxonomy
  const taxonomy = await mp.taxonomies.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "product_categories",
    description: "Product category classification",
    taxonomy_type: "flat",
    retriever: {
      retriever_id: "ret_def456",  // Existing retriever for matching
      threshold: 0.7               // Similarity threshold
    },
    source_collections: [
      {
        collection_id: "col_categories",
        enrichment_fields: ["category", "department", "tax_rate"]
      }
    ]
  });
  
  const taxonomyId = taxonomy.taxonomy_id;
  console.log(`Created taxonomy: ${taxonomyId}`);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Hierarchical Taxonomy

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  # Create a hierarchical taxonomy
  taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
      namespace_id="ns_abc123",
      name="organization_structure",
      description="Company organizational structure",
      taxonomy_type="hierarchical",
      retriever={
          "retriever_id": "ret_ghi789"
      },
      hierarchical_config={
          "collection_nodes": [
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_people",
                  "parent_collection_id": None,  # Top-level collection
                  "enrichment_fields": ["name", "basic_access"]
              },
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_employees",
                  "parent_collection_id": "col_people",  # Child of people
                  "enrichment_fields": ["employee_id", "department"]
              },
              {
                  "collection_id": "col_executives",
                  "parent_collection_id": "col_employees",  # Child of employees
                  "enrichment_fields": ["executive_level", "budget_authority"]
              }
          ]
      }
  )
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  // Create a hierarchical taxonomy
  const taxonomy = await mp.taxonomies.create({
    namespace_id: "ns_abc123",
    name: "organization_structure",
    description: "Company organizational structure",
    taxonomy_type: "hierarchical",
    retriever: {
      retriever_id: "ret_ghi789"
    },
    hierarchical_config: {
      collection_nodes: [
        {
          collection_id: "col_people",
          parent_collection_id: null,  // Top-level collection
          enrichment_fields: ["name", "basic_access"]
        },
        {
          collection_id: "col_employees",
          parent_collection_id: "col_people",  // Child of people
          enrichment_fields: ["employee_id", "department"]
        },
        {
          collection_id: "col_executives",
          parent_collection_id: "col_employees",  // Child of employees
          enrichment_fields: ["executive_level", "budget_authority"]
        }
      ]
    }
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Applying Taxonomies

Once you've created a taxonomy, you can apply it to enrich documents in your collections.

## Materialization Options

When applying taxonomies, you have two main materialization options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Materialized" icon="database">
    Creates enriched documents in a specified output collection
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Faster query performance
    - Pre-computed enrichments
    - Historical enrichment tracking
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Requires additional storage
    - Needs re-application when taxonomy changes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="On-Demand" icon="bolt">
    Computes enrichments during query execution
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Always uses latest taxonomy
    - No duplicate storage required
    - Automatic updates with taxonomy changes
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Higher query-time compute costs
    - Potentially slower query performance
    - Cannot track historical enrichment changes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Taxonomy Node Structure

In a hierarchical taxonomy, nodes are documents in collections with specific structures:

```json
// Example: Executive node in a hierarchical taxonomy
{
  "document_id": "doc_abc123",
  "collection_id": "col_executives",
  // Person properties (inherited from col_people)
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "basic_access": true,
  
  // Employee properties (inherited from col_employees)
  "employee_id": "E12345",
  "department": "Marketing",
  
  // Executive-specific properties
  "executive_level": "VP",
  "budget_authority": 5000000,
  
  // Embedding for matching
  "face_embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
}
```

### Property Inheritance

In hierarchical taxonomies, properties are inherited from parent to child nodes:

- Child nodes inherit all properties from their parent nodes
- Child nodes can override inherited properties with their own values
- Inheritance follows the collection hierarchy defined in the taxonomy


## Using Enriched Documents

Once you've applied a taxonomy, you can use the enriched fields in searches and filters:

```python
# Search using enriched taxonomy fields
results = mp.retrievers.execute(
    retriever_id="ret_jkl012",
    query={
        "text": "marketing presentation"
    },
    filters={
        "department": "Marketing",  # Taxonomy-enriched field
        "executive_level": {"$exists": True}  # Only match executive content
    }
)
```

## Example Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Product Categorization">
    Create a product taxonomy to automatically classify products and inherit category properties:
    
    ```python
    # Create product category taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="product_hierarchy",
        description="Product category hierarchy",
        taxonomy_type="hierarchical",
        retriever={
            "retriever_id": "ret_product_matcher"
        },
        hierarchical_config={
            "collection_nodes": [
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_categories",
                    "parent_collection_id": None,
                    "enrichment_fields": ["category", "tax_group"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_subcategories",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_categories",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["subcategory", "warranty_policy"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_product_types",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_subcategories",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["product_type", "return_window"]
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
    
    This creates a three-level product hierarchy where each level inherits properties from its parent.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Content Tagging">
    Create a flat taxonomy for automatically tagging content with relevant topics:
    
    ```python
    # Create content tagging taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="content_topics",
        description="Content topic classification",
        taxonomy_type="flat",
        retriever={
            "retriever_id": "ret_topic_matcher",
            "threshold": 0.6
        },
        source_collections=[
            {
                "collection_id": "col_topics",
                "enrichment_fields": ["topic", "subtopics", "audience_level"]
            }
        ]
    )
    ```
    
    Apply this taxonomy to automatically tag articles, blog posts, or other content with relevant topics.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Face Recognition">
    Create a hierarchical taxonomy for recognizing faces and applying appropriate metadata:
    
    ```python
    # Create face recognition taxonomy
    taxonomy = mp.taxonomies.create(
        namespace_id="ns_abc123",
        name="personnel_faces",
        description="Personnel face recognition",
        taxonomy_type="hierarchical",
        retriever={
            "retriever_id": "ret_face_matcher"
        },
        hierarchical_config={
            "collection_nodes": [
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_people",
                    "parent_collection_id": None,
                    "enrichment_fields": ["name", "id_verified"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_employees",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_people",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["employee_id", "department", "title"]
                },
                {
                    "collection_id": "col_visitors",
                    "parent_collection_id": "col_people",
                    "enrichment_fields": ["visitor_type", "access_level"]
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    ```
    
    This taxonomy can be used to automatically identify and tag people in images or videos based on their organizational role.

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Thoughtful Hierarchies">
    For hierarchical taxonomies, carefully plan the levels and inheritance relationships to avoid redundancy and maximize usability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Retriever Performance">
    Create efficient retrievers for taxonomy matching, focusing on the most distinctive features for each node type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider Materialization Strategy">
    Choose between materialized and on-demand enrichment based on your query patterns, update frequency, and storage constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Representative Data">
    Validate taxonomy performance with representative test data before applying to your full collection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Taxonomies with many nodes or complex hierarchies can impact application performance. Optimize your taxonomy structure and retriever configuration for the best balance of accuracy and performance.
