title: "Observability"

<Note>
  Mixpeek provides comprehensive observability tools to help you understand system performance, track usage, and diagnose issues across your collections, pipelines, and queries.
</Note>

## Overview

Observability in Mixpeek is divided into two main categories: Insights and Profiling. Insights offer a high-level, aggregated view of your system over time, while Profiling provides detailed, real-time analysis of specific operations.

## Insights

Insights provide aggregated metrics and visualizations to help you understand the long-term behavior and performance of your Mixpeek resources. This includes dashboards showing trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and overall usage statistics.

---

## Profiling

Profiling offers granular, often real-time, views into individual processes, queries, or operations. This includes detailed logs, execution traces, and event streams (like a firehose) to help you debug specific issues or optimize performance on a case-by-case basis.

<Note>
  Use Insights to monitor overall health and trends, and dive into Profiling when you need to investigate specific events or performance bottlenecks.
