<Note>
  Understanding these concepts will help you utilize the Mixpeek Multimodal Warehouse offerings.
</Note>

Mixpeek organizes data in a structured hierarchy designed for flexibility and performance of multimodal content processing and retrieval.


| Mixpeek Term | Description | Data Warehouse Analogy |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Namespace](/ingestion/namespaces) | Query boundaries that isolate environments | Database/Schema |
| [Bucket](/ingestion/buckets) | Storage containers for raw objects and files | Raw Data Lake/Storage Layer |
| [Object](/ingestion/objects) | Collections of related input files | Raw Data Files/Source Documents |
| [Blob](/ingestion/objects) | Individual raw files within Objects | Binary Data/Single File |
| [Collection](/ingestion/collections) | Groups of processed documents with consistent schema | Table |
| [Document](/ingestion/collections) | Structured outputs from feature extractors | Row |
| [Feature Extractor](/processing/feature-extractors) | Specialized components that process inputs to extract specific features | ETL Process/Transformation |
| [Feature](/ingestion/features) | Extracted data elements stored in feature stores | Column/Field |
| [Feature Store](/ingestion/features) | Specialized storage for extracted features optimized for efficient retrieval | Indexed Columns/Materialized Views |
| [Retriever](/retrieval/retrievers) | Query engines that search feature stores to find relevant documents | SQL Query Engine |
| [Retriever Stage](/retrieval/retrievers) | Components of search pipelines that perform specific operations in the retrieval process | Query Execution Plan Step |
| [Taxonomy](/enrichment/taxonomies) | Multimodal equivalent of SQL JOIN operations | JOIN Operation |
| [Clustering](/enrichment/clusters) | Multimodal equivalent of SQL GROUP BY operations | GROUP BY Operation |
| [Research](/retrieval/research) | Multi-step process that explores topics through iterative searches, generates structured reports with sections, and combines retrieved information into cohesive content | Business Intelligence Report |



## Component Relationships

The different components in Mixpeek relate to each other in specific ways:

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    NS[Namespaces] --> BK[Buckets]
    BK --> OBJ[Objects]
    OBJ --> BAT[Batches]
    BAT --> FX[Feature Extractors]
    FX --> DOC[Documents]
    DOC --> COL[Collections]
    FX --> FS[Feature Stores]
    TAX[Taxonomies] --> DOC
    CLU[Clusters] --> DOC
    RET[Retrievers] --> FS

    style FX fill:#FC5185,stroke:#333
    style DOC fill:#FC5185,stroke:#333
  ```
</Frame>

### Understanding the Relationships

- Buckets contain Objects; Objects are grouped into Batches for processing.
- Submitting a Batch runs Feature Extractors to produce Documents and Feature Stores.
- Documents (features + metadata) live in Collections.
- Taxonomies enrich Documents; Clusters group Documents.
- Retrievers query Feature Stores and return ranked Documents.

## Processing Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Feature Extractors" icon="microchip">
    Specialized components that process inputs to extract features (embeddings, faces, scenes, objects, transcripts). They populate feature stores and produce documents in collections.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Retrievers" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Configurable pipelines that combine KNN over feature stores, metadata filters, grouping, and reranking to return relevant documents.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## SQL Analogs

- JOIN → Taxonomies: similarity joins that enrich documents (flat or hierarchical).
- GROUP BY → Clustering: groups similar documents; can output centroids/artifacts.

## Metadata and Document Properties

All documents in Mixpeek collections include standard metadata properties:

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_123",           // Unique document identifier
  "collection_id": "col_456def",      // Collection this document belongs to
  "source_details": [                   // Lineage and processing info for this doc
    {
      "type": "bucket",               // Immediate origin type (bucket/collection/taxonomy/cluster)
      "source_id": "bkt_789",         // Immediate source identifier (e.g., bucket_id)
      "object_id": "obj_123abc",      // Originating object id
      "feature_extractor_task_id": "ray_task_fx_1", // Ray task that ran the extractor
      "object_task_id": "ray_task_obj_1",           // Ray task that orchestrated the object
      "feature_extractor_id": "clip_vit_l_14@1.0.0" // Extractor instance that produced features
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {},                       // User-provided metadata
  "internal_metadata": {},              // System-generated metadata
  "vector": null,                       // Optional vector embedding in this response
  "presigned_url": null,                // Optional signed URL for the primary asset
  "enrichments": null,                  // Optional taxonomy/cluster enrichments
  "source_blobs": []                    // Optional list of source blob descriptors
}
```
