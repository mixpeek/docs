## Mixpeek Simplification

<CodeGroup>
    ```python Ingest
    # Single call to index any content
    response = mixpeek.index(
        url="your-content-url",
        collection_id="your-collection",
        feature_extractors=["text", "image", "video"]
    )
    ```

    ```python Search
    # Single call to search across all modalities
    results = mixpeek.search(
        queries=["your search query"],
        collection_ids=["your-collection"],
        embedding_model="multimodal"
    )
    ```
</CodeGroup>
