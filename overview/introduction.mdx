description: "Meet the Mixpeek multimodal data processing and retrieval platform"
---

<Note>
  Mixpeek turns raw multimodal inputs—text, images, video, audio, PDFs—into structured documents, reusable features, and query-ready indexes. A strict separation between API and Engine layers lets you ingest, enrich, and retrieve at scale without coupling application logic to heavy compute.
</Note>

## Platform at a Glance

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Layered Architecture" icon="server">
  - **API layer (FastAPI + Celery)** orchestrates object intake, enrichment, and retrieval
  - **Engine layer (Ray)** executes distributed feature extraction and inference on CPU/GPU workers
  - **Shared storage** (MongoDB, Qdrant, Redis, S3) keeps metadata, vectors, and artifacts consistent
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hard Isolation" icon="shield-check">
  - Every request authenticates with an organization-scoped API key
  - The `X-Namespace` header enforces namespace-scoped queries and writes
  - Qdrant collections, MongoDB queries, and task execution are namespaced by default
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable Pipelines" icon="layer-group">
  - Configure extraction pipelines with [Feature Extractors](/processing/feature-extractors)
  - Chain multi-stage [Retrievers](/retrieval/retrievers) to search, filter, rank, enrich, and transform
  - Reuse retrievers inside other retrievers for modular, reusable search flows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Guardrails" icon="bolt">
  - Materialized taxonomies, clustering jobs, and caching deliver low-latency responses
  - Task status, webhooks, and analytics offer production-grade observability
  - Autoscaling Ray workers match ingestion and retrieval workloads automatically
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Isolate tenants with namespaces">
    Provision namespaces (or use the default) to keep tenants and environments separate. Pass `X-Namespace` on every authenticated request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register raw objects">
    Store files or JSON payloads as [Objects](/ingestion/objects) inside schema-backed [Buckets](/ingestion/buckets). Mixpeek tracks blobs, metadata, and lineage without processing yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define collections and extract features">
    Create [Collections](/ingestion/collections) to map object fields into feature extractor inputs. The Engine downloads per-extractor artifacts, runs Ray tasks, and writes documents plus vectors to Qdrant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enrich with taxonomies and clustering">
    Apply [Taxonomies](/enrichment/taxonomies) (flat or hierarchical) or [Clusters](/enrichment/clusters) to attach structured metadata. Both reuse the JOIN stage for fast, parallel enrichment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve with multi-stage pipelines">
    Compose [Retrievers](/retrieval/retrievers) from search, filter, rank, enrich, transform, and compose stages. Fetch presigned URLs, execution metrics, and cache-aware responses in a single API call.
  </Step>
</Steps>
