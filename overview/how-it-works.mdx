description: "Understanding Mixpeek's architecture and capabilities"
---

Mixpeek provides infrastructure that allows developers to construct their own search experiences, aligned to their business. It enables this via three layers:

1. **Feature Extraction** - Extract meaningful information from any content type using state-of-the-art models (OSS, BYO, or Mixpeek proprietary)
2. **Entity Enrichment** - Enhance extracted features with domain knowledge through manual classification, automatic clustering, and relationship mapping
3. **Search & Discovery** - Build powerful search experiences with vector similarity, filtering, grouping, and advanced capabilities like Learning to Rank and Fine-Tuning. 

## 1. Multimodal Feature Extraction

Features are the core primitive in Mixpeek. They represent extracted information from any content type using state-of-the-art AI models.

### Example: Video Processing

<CodeGroup>
```json Video Feature Extraction
{
  "feature_extractors": [
    {
      "interval_sec": 5,
      "embed": [
        {
          "type": "url",
          "embedding_model": "vertex-multimodal"  // Scene understanding
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "value": "red dog",
          "embedding_model": "vertex-multimodal"  // Append additional data about the scene
        }
      ],
      "transcribe": { 
        "enabled": true,
        "embedding_model": "bge-m5" // transcribe and embed the transcription using a multilingual model
      },
      "detect": {
        "faces": {
          "enabled": true, // grab the faces out and match against your internally enrolled face collection
          "confidence_threshold": 0.8
        }
      },
      "describe": { "enabled": true } // create a description of the video
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Feature Enrichment

Once features are extracted, they can be enriched with domain knowledge through three main mechanisms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Taxonomies" icon="sitemap">
    Manual classification using predefined hierarchies for strict content organization
    
    [Learn More →](/entities/taxonomies)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clusters" icon="object-group">
    Automatic content grouping using similarity and patterns
    
    [Learn More →](/entities/clusters)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Relationships" icon="diagram-project">
    Define connections between features, nodes, and clusters
    
    [Learn More →](/entities/relationships)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Domain Knowledge Integration

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Features] --> B[Enrichment Layer]
    B --> C[Enhanced Features]
    
    subgraph "Enrichment Layer"
    D[Taxonomies] --> F[Domain Knowledge]
    E[Clusters] --> F
    F --> G[Relationships]
    end
```

## 3. Search & Discovery

Enriched features enable powerful search capabilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core Search Features">
    - Vector similarity search
    - Filtering by metadata and entities
    - Result grouping
    - Pagination and sorting
    
    [Learn More →](/search/overview)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Capabilities">
    - Learning to Rank (LTR)
    - Search interaction tracking
    - Collaborative filtering
    - Model fine-tuning

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Search Configuration Example

<CodeGroup>
```json Search with Filters and Groups
{
  "queries": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "product demonstration",
      "embedding_model": "text"
    }
  ],
  "filters": {
    "AND": [
      {
        "key": "entities[].node",
        "operator": "in",
        "value": ["training_videos"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "group_by": {
    "field": "asset_id",
    "max_features": 10
  }
}
```
