## Technology Stack

Our architecture leverages best-in-class technologies selected for performance, reliability, and scalability:

- **[Temporal](https://temporal.io/)**: Powers our workflow orchestration for fault-tolerance and reliable execution of complex, long-running processes
- **[Ray](https://ray.io/)**: Enables distributed computing for efficient parallel processing of feature extraction workloads
- **[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)**: Provides high-performance vector search capabilities with ANN indexing for sub-second queries at scale
- **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Offers analytical capabilities with minimal overhead for comprehensive system monitoring
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: Ensures consistent, isolated environments for feature extractors across deployments
- **[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)**: Facilitates secure, event-driven data ingestion from S3 with minimal configuration
- **[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**: Provides durable storage for source objects with versioning and lifecycle management

## Extensibility

Mixpeek is designed with extensibility as a core principle:

- **Self-hosting Options**: Deploy key components on your infrastructure for enhanced control and compliance
- **Custom Feature Extractors**: Integrate your own extractors via our standardized container interface
- **API-first Design**: All functionality is accessible through well-documented APIs
- **Pluggable Authentication**: Support for various auth providers including OAuth, API keys, and custom JWT solutions
- **Bring Your Own Storage**: Connect existing storage solutions while maintaining our processing capabilities

## Core Components

### Data Ingestion
- **S3 Integration**: Secure Change Data Capture (CDC) via AWS Lambda functions deployed to your account
- **Direct Upload**: HTTP POST endpoint for direct file uploads via Bucket Object API
- **Scalable Storage**: Efficient management of files regardless of size or format

### Processing Pipeline
- **Temporal Orchestration**: Workflow engine that manages the entire processing lifecycle
- **Ray Clusters**: Distributed computing framework for parallel processing
- **Feature Extractors**: Specialized processing units with dedicated resources:
  - Each runs in isolated Docker containers
  - Configurable EC2 hardware footprint
  - GPU/TPU accelerator support where needed
  - Auto-scaling based on workload

### Vector Storage
- **Qdrant**: High-performance vector database for storing extracted features
- **Optimized Indices**: Fast similarity search across multimedia content
- **Multi-modal Support**: Unified approach to handling different data types

### Monitoring & Observability
- **DuckDB**: Analytics engine for logging and monitoring system performance
- **Task Tracking**: Comprehensive visibility into processing status
- **Error Handling**: Robust recovery mechanisms for failed operations

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Content enters the system via S3 integration or direct API upload
2. **Orchestration**: Temporal workflows coordinate processing based on collection configuration
3. **Feature Extraction**: Multiple extractors process content in parallel, generating specialized embeddings
4. **Storage**: Extracted features are stored in Qdrant for efficient retrieval
5. **Search & Retrieval**: Optimized vector search enables powerful content discovery capabilities

### Authentication & Security

All API requests require authentication via API keys. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, with granular access controls at the namespace, bucket, and collection levels.

### Task Management

Long-running operations are managed via our task system:
- Tasks are tracked with unique IDs
- Status updates are available in real-time
- Failures trigger automatic retry mechanisms with configurable policies
- Tasks can be monitored and controlled through dedicated API endpoints

This architecture ensures maximum performance, reliability, and scalability as your content library grows.
