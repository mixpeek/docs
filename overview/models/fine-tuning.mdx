<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Annotated Data">
    Send your annotated data to an S3 bucket.
    Ensure the data is well-organized and labeled according to the model's requirements
    (we'll provide specs)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Fine-Tuning">
    Use the Mixpeek Dashboard (and soon to be API) to schedule a fine-tuning job. Specify the base
    `model_id`, the S3 bucket path, and `specs` that tell the fine-tuner how to run.

    This will return a new model_id, for example: `model_1askdh2390`, which you'll then use in your methods like:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Version Control">
    It's recommended to store the version_id of each model state as it is fine-tuned. 
    
    If you append a `model_version` in the metadata of the pipeline it'll automatically be added to your database so you can do query-time filtering.
