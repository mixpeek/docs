## Request

<ParamField body="input" type="string" required>
  The text input for which embeddings are to be generated. This can be any string of text whose semantic meaning you wish to capture in a dense vector format, enabling advanced search and analysis capabilities.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="modality" type="string" optional>
  The modality of the input data. Specifies the type of data to be processed, with "text" as the default modality.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" optional>
  The model used for generating embeddings. Specifies the AI model, with "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" as the default.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="embedding" type="array" required>
  The generated embedding for the input text. This is a dense vector representation that captures the semantic meaning of the input, allowing for similarity comparisons and enhanced search functionality.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="elapsed_time" type="number" optional>
  The time taken to generate the embedding, measured in milliseconds. Provides insight into the processing time for the embedding generation.
</ResponseField>
