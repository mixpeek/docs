## Request

<ParamField body="file_url" type="string" optional>
  The URL of the document from which content is to be extracted. Provide a direct link to the document you wish to process, allowing Mixpeek to access and analyze its contents. Either `file_url` or `contents` must be provided, but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="contents" type="string" optional>
  The direct textual or base64-encoded content of the document for extraction. Use this field if you prefer to upload document content directly rather than via a URL. Either `file_url` or `contents` must be provided, but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="should_chunk" type="boolean" optional>
  Indicates whether the text should be divided into manageable chunks. This can be useful for processing large documents or for applications requiring segmented analysis.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="other_parameters" type="string" optional>
  Includes additional processing parameters such as `clean_text`, `max_characters_per_chunk`, `extract_tags`, `summarize`, and format-specific settings (`pdf_settings`, `html_settings`, etc.), tailored to enhance the extraction based on the document's modality and content.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="output" type="array" required>
  An array of elements extracted from the document. Each element may represent a piece of text, an image description, or other relevant content blocks, along with their metadata like page numbers, languages, and file type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="object" required>
  Metadata related to the extraction process, detailing the document type, processing time, and any other pertinent information about the extracted content.
</ResponseField>
